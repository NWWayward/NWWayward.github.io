But, yeah, it’s pretty distracting. This gives a -1 penalty to all d20 rolls, aside from Genjutsu defenses: It’s -2 for them.</p> <h6 id="11---25-bruised-arm">(11 - 25) Bruised (Arm)</h6> <p>Your arm is bruised. It hurts. This gives a -1 Accuracy penalty (because of the pain being distracting, if you’re attacking without using the arm) and increases your Seal Speeds by 1.</p> <h6 id="26---55-bruised-ribs-torso">(26 - 55) Bruised Ribs (Torso)</h6> <p>As in the bones, not the skin over them. Truth is, ribs hurt a lot more than they have any business doing. Breathing hurts in particular, deep breathing especially so. This increases the Speed of all your non-variable-speed actions by 1. You’ll recover from this at the end of the week.</p> <h6 id="56---80-winded-abdomen">(56 - 80) Winded (Abdomen)</h6> <p>A good shot to the gut hit your solar plexus or compressed your diaphragm, or both, knocking the wind out of you. You’ll be fine, definitely, but this increases your Stamina penalty by 4 and applies a Stun 4.</p> <h6 id="81---100-bruised-leg">(81 - 100) Bruised (Leg)</h6> <p>Something hit your leg and now it hurts! You’ll feel better after you walk it off (or just sit down and let the pain fade). Until the end of battle this reduces your base movement speed by 10% and applies a -1 penalty to dodge rolls.</p> <h2 id="blunt-major">Blunt (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-dazed-head">(1 - 10) Dazed (Head)</h6> <p>That one left you reeling. Once you’re done seeing stars, you’ll be.. mostly okay. You are automatically knocked Prone, and you suffer the effects of Ringing Noise (Blunt Minor Head wound) on top of it. You also drop all Upkeeps you were maintaining. Everything seems just a little bit… off, about the world, though you can’t quite place what. Sounds are muffled, colors muted, and things keep moving at the edge of your vision. This wound lasts for four weeks.</p> <h6 id="11---25-sprained-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Sprained Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>Your elbow or wrist was forced to bend in a way it’s not meant to by the blow, and sprained in the process. Firstly, you drop anything you’re holding in the arm affected. Secondly, you take a -1 to Accuracy and -2 to your PDB, and you increase all Seal Speeds by 2. It takes two weeks to recover from, though weeks in which you use the arm don’t count towards its recovery.</p> <h6 id="26---55-collapsed-lung-torso">(26 - 55) Collapsed Lung (Torso)</h6> <p>Whatever hit you managed to knock you across the battlefield and made your lung quit its day job; unfortunately, that day job was letting you breathe. You’re knocked back 8 yards (or increase the attack’s existing knockback by 8), and your Fatigue rolls have a -4 penalty; you can live with both lungs collapsed, though that raises the penalty to -12 (rather than just -8), though taking this wound more than twice doesn’t increase the penalty. It takes only a week of medical treatment to get over this, but it won’t get better without that treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-groin-shot-abdomen">(56 - 80) Groin Shot (Abdomen)</h6> <p>If this was a called shot, you should probably having a serious talk with your opponent about what constitutes fair fighting. It automatically knocks you prone, and inflicts a Stun 16, and until it’s healed, you take a -4 to all status rolls (whether inflicting or resisting). It takes two weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="81---100-sprained-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Sprained Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>The muscles and ligaments in your knee or ankle were stretched beyond their capacity. You’re automatically knocked prone upon first taking the wound, and take -1 to Dodges and -10% movespeed, which is doubled for 10 IC after you move (as an action) or dodge. It takes four weeks to heal.</p> <h2 id="blunt-severe">Blunt (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-concussion-head">(1 - 10) Concussion (Head)</h6> <p>Somebody turned out the lights. It is very dark, and you are likely to be eaten by a grue. Thankfully, you get over that before your enemies can capitalize on it (or you’re eaten). You take a -3 to all d20 rolls and reduce all AP gains by 3. Whenever you suffer a Head wound (of any type: Slashing, Piercing, etc.), you have a stacking 10% chance to suffer Ringing Noise (Minor Blunt Head wound) in addition to the other one; the chance resets to 10% each time you suffer it, but doesn’t go away until the wound itself does (along with its other penalties), which takes twelve weeks to recover from without rest, but if you take any other head wound while this one is healing, its recovery time completely resets. Medical treatment does not help this wound heal any faster.</p> <h6 id="11---25-broken-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Broken Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>Someone broke your arm, which has left it more or less unusable at present unless there’s a medic-nin nearby who’s willing to take pity on you. The arm broken can’t be used in grapples (and if both are broken, you can’t initiate a grapple at all), you can’t wield or use two-handed weapons at all, and you take a Stun 6 whenever you parry. The worst part of all, however, is that you can’t benefit from any increase to your PDB or NDB from Upkeeps until it heals, as you’re unable to effectively fully reinforce your attacks. Two months of not using the arm will be sufficient for it to heal.</p> <h6 id="26---55-broken-ribs-torso">(26 - 55) Broken Ribs (Torso)</h6> <p>You are in horrible, terrible pain. You’d be screaming and/or mewling, if you weren’t a ninja! Breathing feels like you’re being stabbed–and depending on how badly broken those ribs are, that might be exactly what’s happening. You can no longer Block, and you take a -2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, along with increasing the speed of all actions by 2 (though this does not increase their damage). Attacks which reduce blocking’s effectiveness (such as weapon attacks, and Raiton) additionally force you to make a status roll against the attacker’s Athletics (for Taijutsu) or Chakra Control (for ninjutsu/genjutsu), and if you fail, the penalties from this wound are doubled for 30 IC (becoming -4 Accuracy and d20 rolls and +4 speed to all actions, for example). It takes eight weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="56---80-crushed-organ-abdomen">(56 - 80) Crushed Organ (Abdomen)</h6> <p>It’s not as bad as it sounds, honestly. There’s some severe bleeding and bruising inside the organ itself, and it hurts horrendously, but it’s not bleeding out into other parts of your body.. so it could be worse. Unfortunately, it’s still quite painful and completely prevents you from being able to use the Rest action in combat, and applies a -8 to Resistance rolls thanks to the pain from one organ spreading to all the others nearby. Each week the penalty to Resistance is reduced by one, though you can’t Rest until the penalty is 0 (and this wound is then considered healed).</p> <h6 id="81---100-broken-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Broken Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>Severe damage to your leg has left you with a reduced ability to locomote around the battlefield! If worst comes to worst, you can still power-hobble on it; it doesn’t directly penalize your movement, but moving has a Stun 5 added to it (even moving as part of an attack), and you can’t use any sort of jutsu to move (like Vaulting Leap) or increase your movement speed (like Lightning Warrior) so long as your leg is broken. Your leg won’t get better if you’re walking around on it. If you walk with crutches (or a cane, or something of the sort) you can move at only half speed, but it allows you move around while recovering from this wound, which takes a total of two months. Each time you opt to run around unaided on it extends the remaining recovering time by a week.</p> <h2 id="blunt-critical">Blunt (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-fractured-skull-head">(1 - 10) Fractured Skull (Head)</h6> <p>You got hit in the head hard enough that you’re lucky you don’t have (much) brain damage. This will usually be accompanied by nasty lacerations and prolific bleeding, but not always. Aside from a Stun 16, you suffer a -4 penalty to Accuracy and all d20 rolls, which is doubled for Genjutsu. This takes 15 weeks to heal. If you suffer a Head Wound (of any type) while you have and are recovering from this wound, roll 1d20: On 1 - 10, you go unconscious and comatose until that wound fully heals (even if it takes longer than it does for your Fractured Skull to finish healing), on a 11 - 20 you suffer another Stun 16. You will be comatose and unconscious for a minimum of 24 hours after triggering this effect, even for a Minor head wound.</p> <h6 id="11---25-shattered-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Shattered Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>You arm is so broken that the breaks have breaks. It’s useless. You can’t perform handseals, hold weapons or use items with it, and so forth. Thanks to the pain, and the fact that all your attacks are basically coming from the same angle with one arm now a non-factor, you take a -5 to Accuracy until you can regain the use of your arm. After four weeks of medical treatment, the pain will be manageable, and the penalties will be reduced to a mere -3 Accuracy (though you still can’t use the arm). Only after that will it begin to actually heal, which takes a total of ten weeks, or twenty without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="26---55-sternal-fracture-torso">(26 - 55) Sternal Fracture (Torso)</h6> <p>Your sternum is that rather lengthy, thoroughly sturdy piece of bone and cartilage that runs down the middle of your chest that all your ribs connect to. They’re pretty hard to break. Nice job pulling that one off. This in itself isn’t terribly bad, but whatever hit you with enough force to do that off also managed to break several ribs and cause some significant internal damage. It’s pretty easy to tell your chest is just about ruined: there’s a grinding nose of bone on bone whenever you breathe or try to move too much, for one thing; the agonizing pain’s a pretty good hint, too, inflicting a -5 to all Fatigue rolls and reducing your PDB and NDB by 5. It also makes it much more difficult to maintain and regulate your chakra thanks to your body’s general imbalance, increasing the cost of all Upkeeps by 2.</p> <p>Every week the Fatigue penalty reduces by one. Once that penalty clears, your damage bonuses have their penalty reduced by one every two weeks, and once those are both back to normal, the penalty to Upkeeps goes away.</p> <h6 id="56---80-rupture-abdomen">(56 - 80) Rupture (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Your abdomen’s important because it’s full of all sorts of squishy parts that are pretty important for your continued survival. Whatever kind of trauma you just went through ruptured one of those squishy bits, and now it’s bleeding out all over your insides. Yes, blood belongs inside you, but… not actually inside your abdominal cavity. Every time you act, including movement, you lose HP (not Vitality) equal to the Speed of the action, and roll 1d100 against the action’s Speed*2. If you fail, the rupture is aggravated, and you gain a Poison 1 with a duration equal to the Speed of the action you just took. Every time you take this effect in the same battle, the Poison severity increases by 1 (Poison 1 the first time, Poison 2 the second, etc); there is no limit to how high this can go, and can be fatal. You can suffer from multiple different Poison statuses from this effect at once. Attempts to treat this wound with First Aid require at least 20 ranks in Medicine, and requires a medically inclined person to drain the abdomen of blood before figuring out what’s actually bleeding and making it stop. It’s a Speed 25 action to treat it in this manner, which stops any ongoing Poison statuses from this wound and resets the Poison severity for the combat. It takes 15 weeks to recover from this injury, which won’t heal without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="81---100-shattered-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Shattered Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>There are broken legs, there are severely broken legs, and then there’s your leg. You can’t stand without something to prop you up, but because you’re a tough-as-nails and super resourceful ninja you can still move, though you do so at half speed. You have a -5 penalty to Dodges and Athletics rolls, the former of which is doubled against Area of Effect attacks.</p> <p>Once you’ve had two weeks of medical treatment and been put in a splint, you can walk so long as you carry a crutch, cane, or walking stick (which does occupy a hand), reducing the penalties to -3, though you still move at half speed. You can do so without out, though each time you take any action which requires you to move (including dodging), or are hit, you have a 50% chance of your leg giving out and resetting the recovery time from this injury. Once you’ve received treatment, it takes twenty weeks to heal, though if you try to go without any medical treatment it’ll take thirty.</p> <h2 id="energy-minor">Energy (Minor)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-sun-spots-head">(1 - 10) Sun Spots (Head)</h6> <p>You were a little too slow in closing your eyes when hit, and now vague shapes resembling the oncoming blast seem to float around in front of you, obscuring your vision. It’s annoying, more than anything else. You have a -4 Visibility Penalty, which fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC.</p> <h6 id="11---25-burned-arm">(11 - 25) Burned (Arm)</h6> <p>You’ve been burned! It hurts. The skin is red and starting to swell a little, and touching it (or having it touched) tends to hurt, as it’s now raw. This inflicts a Burn 3, and you suffer a -2 to Accuracy until it goes away due to the pain involved with using the affected limb.</p> <h6 id="26---55-flash-fever-torso">(26 - 55) Flash Fever (Torso)</h6> <p>The center of your body was hit, which is good, since it’s intended to take the brunt of attacks. But whatever hit you also managed to heat you up so much that your body is having trouble regulating your temperature. You feel vaguely sick and tired, but you’ll shake it off soon. You have a -2 to Fatigue rolls until the end of battle.</p> <h6 id="56---80-stomach-blister-abdomen">(56 - 80) Stomach Blister (Abdomen)</h6> <p>A pretty nasty blister managed to emerge from whatever hit you, causing plasma to be stuck within a layer of skin that expanded. It’s gross, and fairly uncomfortable. You’re inflicted with a Burn 3, +1 per time taken in the same battle, along with Immobility 1 which lasts until the Burn ends.</p> <h6 id="81---100-burned-leg">(81 - 100) Burned (Leg)</h6> <p>You’ve been burned! Seriously, it does hurt. Your leg is red and it’s painful when you put your weight on it trying to do things like run. You’re inflicted with a Burn 3, and take a -2 to Dodges until it goes away due to the pain of using the affected limb.</p> <h2 id="energy-major">Energy (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-facial-burn-head">(1 - 10) Facial Burn (Head)</h6> <p>There’s now a nasty burn across your face, the flesh blistered and raw. It’s disorienting, and you can’t get the smell of burnt flesh out of your nostrils, or the taste out of your mouth, which has the effect of nauseating you whenever you try to breathe deeply. As you exert yourself, you smell it more and more and become progressively sicker. Every time you make a Stamina roll you take a -2 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and take a -2 to Stamina rolls every time you make a Chakra Exhaustion roll. This takes a month to heal on your own, or two weeks with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="11---25-second-degree-burn-arm">(11 - 25) Second Degree Burn (Arm)</h6> <p>The majority of your arm is burned. While not life threatening, the amount of skin that’s been burned is substantial, making it a great deal more painful to use the arm in battle. When you perform handseals or attack, you take twice the base Speed of the action as damage, which bypasses all reductions. This takes 5 weeks to heal on its own, 3 with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="26---55-scorched-chest-torso">(26 - 55) Scorched Chest (Torso)</h6> <p>The majority of your body has been burned, taking any hair found on your chest, back, and stomach along with it. Due to the large surface area that entails, it isn’t that deep at any point, but since it covers so much area, it makes it very easy for others to aggravate your injury. You take an additional 10% damage when hit, after all normal reductions but before determining if you suffer wounds. One of the worst parts about it is how it tends to make getting additional wounds that much easier. This takes two weeks to heal, only one with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="56---80-scalded-stomach-abdomen">(56 - 80) Scalded Stomach (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Whatever hit you managed to more or less burn away what covered your midriff and had enough power behind it to significantly heat up your internal organs. This is not good, as your organs can be pretty sensitive about that kind of thing. You take a Stun equal to your RES/10, and have your current and maximum Hit Points and Vitality reduced by your RES until this has healed, which takes three weeks with or without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="81---100-second-degree-burn-leg">(81 - 100) Second Degree Burn (Leg)</h6> <p>One of your legs has been burned down to the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis, causing multiple small blisters to form at the surface which can be easily aggravated every time you go to defend yourself. Every time you perform a defensive interrupt in response to an attack, you suffer damage equal to three times the final Speed of the defensive interrupt, bypassing all reductions. It takes three weeks to heal on its own, but only one with medical treatment.</p> <h2 id="energy-severe">Energy (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-blinded-head">(1 - 10) Blinded (Head)</h6> <p>Your kept your eyes open a little too long when something was aimed right at your face. Just like with it being a bad idea to look directly into the sun, it is also a bad plan to stare directly at a superheated jutsu aimed at your head. Your face as a whole was scalded, but your eyes took the worst of it by remaining open too long. You take a -2 Visibility Penalty, which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC. It is not so bad by itself, until the next time you’re hit by a jutsu that inflicts Energy wounds (regardless of whether or not it does, in fact, actually wound you). When that happens, your visibility penalty is increased by 1 per rank of the jutsu (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.), to a maximum of -8. The technique must deal damage to trigger this effect of the wound. It takes a long time for your eyes to not be so sensitive, reducing the penalty you incur when blinded by 1 every two weeks–for a total of a ten weeks recovery time, to not be blinded by A-rank jutsu. With medical attention, the recovery time is halved.</p> <h6 id="11---25-muscle-melting-arms">(11 - 25) Muscle Melting (Arms)</h6> <p>Not quite as literal as the name implies, but no less serious an injury–you’ve been burned so deep that he muscle itself has been affected. Aside from intense pain, it also weakens the muscle as a substantial section of it has become damaged and useless. Your damage bonuses (Physical and Ninjutsu) are lowered by 10%, and you have a -1 penalty to Accuracy. As you continually use the muscles and chakra pathways that flow through the damaged area, the heat builds and spreads to worsen the injury, inflicting even more damage to both muscles and tenketsu. Whenever you deal damage, the Damage Bonus which was used is afterward lowered by 5%, to a minimum of 50% (halving your damage bonus). When either reaches 50%, your Accuracy is lowered by an additional 1 point, to a maximum of -3 (when both PDB and NDB reach 50% reduction). Additional wounds add 10% to each damage bonus and increases the current and maximum Accuracy penalty by 1, but the 50% reduction cap is unchanged.</p> <p>But despite the wound, a ninja’s body is an amazing machine. Every two weeks, you recover 5% of each damage bonus. With medical attention, you recover that every week. Once both of your damage bonuses are back to normal, the Accuracy penalty goes away, and your bonuses stop decreasing when being used.</p> <h6 id="26---55-dark-halo-torso">(26 - 55) Dark Halo (Torso)</h6> <p>The name comes from the fact that you’ve suffered burns of the entire dermis in a solid, unbroken ring around your body. It is not quite as cool as it sounds–burns of such magnitude can actually cut off circulation to the rest of the body. In short, you’re going into shock, as your body can no longer properly regulate its internal systems. When you advance a fatigue level with this wound, you halve your current penalties to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, instead of clearing them fully. A second instance of this wound has no effect, but resets its recovery time, which takes twelve weeks on its own, or six with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-side-burns-abdomen">(56 - 80) Side Burns (Abdomen)</h6> <p>The sides of your ribcage have been charred and are almost black, hence the name that resembles a much less gruesome looking hairstyle (though, let’s be honest, it’s still pretty bad). Aside from making the definition of your ribcage more obvious, it also makes it harder to breathe. It isn’t so bad here and there, but that quick, almost gasping inhale taken when you try to spur yourself onward makes you pause and lose your breath, slowing you down when you want to be at your quickest. Every time you spend AP equal to or more than your current Willpower on an action, you suffer a Suffocate 2 status after resolving the action which triggered it. Additional instances of this wound increase the Suffocate suffered by 1. The suffocate fades like normal over time, but you will continue to accrue the status effect from this Wound until you take fourteen weeks to let it heal, or seven weeks with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="81---100-fused-foot-leg">(81 - 100) Fused Foot (Leg)</h6> <p>The skin of one of your feet (odds right, evens left) has been burned so badly that the toes are more or less a singular section, melted together. The rest of it isn’t much better, but the most pressing issue how it impairs its functions in battle. For starters, you immediately lose any and all non-jutsu movement speed increases you might have (such as from Runner, or EF), and won’t gain any benefit from them until this wound heals. On top of that, all forms of movement speed for you are reduced by 25%. Finally, you take a -3 to all Defensive Rolls, which greatly limits your options considering ‘run away’ is likely also out of the picture. If you mange to survive the combat which inflicted this wound, fixing it medically is the next hurdle to try and jump with one leg: It takes fourteen weeks to heal on its own (though you still need a first aid kit, and at least 10 ranks in Medicine to do so successfully), but only five with medical treatment. You really don’t want to have to debride your own wounds.</p> <h2 id="energy-critical">Energy (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-eye-welded-shut-head">(1 - 10) Eye Welded Shut (Head)</h6> <p>You got hit in the face by an immense amount of energy, which is basically awful for tons of reasons. Aside from the deep-tissue burns across half your face, the heat was enough to melt the surface of one of your eyelids, fusing it shut. Any ranks in the Enhanced Sight are lost until you recover, as are any abilities dependent upon it. That eye is effectively useless, putting you at a -3 visibility penalty, but it gets worse. The movements of your eyes are synchronous by design: when one looks in a direction, the other follows, meaning that your damaged eye, which is basically glued to your eyelid, is still trying to move around, aggravating the injury further. Every 10 IC which pass with your good eye open, you suffer a -1 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls, with a maximum of -10. However, if you close both your eyes these penalties are reduced by 1 every 20 IC (though be aware that closing both eyes incurs a -10 visibility penalty), to a minimum of half the highest value it’s reached (if it got up to -7, closing your eyes couldn’t reduced it below -4). As a reminder, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0 action, but not an interrupt.</p> <p>This heals naturally, with the penalty being lowered by 1 for every two weeks that go without it being increased. Once it’s been reduced to 0, it takes twelve more weeks to recover. If the penalty returns during that time, healing your eye is interrupted (with ‘progress’ retained) until it’s back to 0. At this point you stop suffering this wound’s effects, but have a semi-permanent -2 visibility penalty. Medical treatment halves all the above times. After another five weeks spent hospitalized, the ‘permanent’ -2 visibility penalty will also be removed.</p> <h6 id="11---25-red-right-hand-arms">(11 - 25) Red Right Hand (Arms)</h6> <p>The name is something of a misnomer, actually–your hand is black. You can’t feel it, you can’t use it. It’s still there, although it’s hard to tell how much of it is salvageable at a glance, because it’s just that badly charred. You lose the usage of a hand. You can not make seals, hold two-handed weapons and so forth. You take a -5 to Accuracy rolls, in addition to being one-handed for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Recovering from this is about as painful and drawn-out as you’d expect from losing most of your hand. It takes thirty weeks on its own, fifteen weeks with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="26---55-atrial-fibrillation-torso">(26 - 55) Atrial Fibrillation (Torso)</h6> <p>The burns to your chest are so deep and severe that they’re affecting your cardiovascular system. Specifically, the heart, and the rhythm at which it beats. Thankfully, this is the less lethal form of fibrillation, as it means your heart is still able to beat properly and pump blood throughout the body, it just does so irregularly. But it’s still pretty bad, as things like fighting cause your pulse to shoot way up, which increases the workload of your heart and makes it more likely and devastating every time your heart skips a beat. Every 15 IC, you take a -1 to Accuracy, Fatigue, and d20 rolls. This penalty can be reduced by half by taking a Rest action (which also resets the 15 IC timer for when it advances), but it can never be reduced below half of the highest penalty you acquired from it (if it reached -7, Resting would reduce it to -4, but then a second Rest action immediately after would not lower it further). When you take the Rest action, you must choose between lowering your Stamina penalty or reducing the penalty from this Wound: you can not do both at the same time.</p> <p>This penalty does not increase outside of combat, but will continue to affect you every time you fight. One of the worst problems with this injury is how it is a chronic condition that the body can’t fix by itself, once it’s happened. You must receive medical attention to get it fixed, and with it, takes six weeks to no longer suffer penalties to d20 rolls. With another six weeks, you don’t take penalties to fatigue, and then with another six you don’t take penalties to Accuracy, and any penalty you still had is removed.</p> <h6 id="56---80-slow-roasted-abdomen">(56 - 80) Slow Roasted (Abdomen)</h6> <p>When something is cooked poorly, the outside tends to burn first, but the inside is typically not that bad. But when something is really charred, it is not just that the outside blackens and dies, but it ends up encapsulating the interior, preventing the escape of heat. That’s basically just what happened to you. So while your skin is flaking from your stomach and looks absolutely horrifying every time you breathe in and out, the real problem is how your insides have been superheated and are unable to effectively cool off. The end result is a constant fever and feeling of sickness that is impossible to ignore. Firstly, you automatically advance one Fatigue level. Secondly, you take -1 to Fatigue rolls every 10 IC which pass: track this penalty separately from all other Fatigue penalties, as this one is not cleared when you advance a Fatigue level. The Rest action becomes Speed 15, for you, and reduces the current penalty you suffer from this wound by half, but not below half of the highest penalty reached in the current battle. Resting no longer reduces Stamina penalties as is normal, nor does it do anything but reduce the penalty from this Wound (such as granting AP, or letting you be considered blocking).</p> <p>Out of combat you recover Fatigue levels at the rate of 1 per OOC day (rather than hour), and cannot recover below Fatigue 1. Similarly, you regain one point of Willpower each OOC day, rather than all your Willpower each day. After sixteen weeks of recovery, you can recover down to Fatigue zero. After another sixteen weeks, your recovery times return to normal. It is very, very difficult for your body to come back from this. Medical attention halves these times.</p> <h6 id="81---100-melted-leg-legs">(81 - 100) Melted Leg (Legs)</h6> <p>Your clothing and leg were both burnt so horridly that it’s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Much to your displeasure, you can still feel the limb–or, rather, the mass of agonizing pain where your functional leg used to be. When you move, bits of black flake off–probably best not to think about whether or not that’s you or your outfit. Your movement speed is reduced by 25%, and you take a -6 to all Defensive rolls.</p> <p>This takes thirty weeks to heal on its own (but you really don’t want to do that), but only twelve with medical attention.</p> <h2 id="piercing">Piercing</h2> <h4 id="--needling--">-=[ Needling ]=-</h4> <p>Needling is a status effect, unique to Piercing wounds. Every Piercing wound will inflict some amount of Needling, which represents the slow, steady pain and debilitating efect of being stabbed, which accordingly fully stacks with itself. One or two you can typically bear without too much trouble (assuming they don’t go through you), but the more puncture wounds you take, the harder it becomes to have those bursts of energy that ninja depend upon to turn the tide of battle. Needling reduces your current and maximum Action Points according to its Severity, to a minimum of 0 for your current AP, and a minimum of half your normal maximum (i.e., if you had an AGI of 100, your normal maximum would be 100/2 = 50, which could be reduced as low as 25 from Needling).</p> <p>Even if a Piercing wound has a timed effect, the maximum AP reduction aspect of Needling from the wound lasts until the end of the battle. Wounds that are healed mid-battle similarly have their AP reduction removed (though you do not regain any current AP that was lost as a result), and it is possible to heal a Piercing wound whose main effect has ended, but its AP reduction from Needling remains.</p> <h2 id="piercing-minor">Piercing (Minor)</h2> <h6 id="1---20-reflexive-flinch-arm">(1 - 20) Reflexive Flinch (Arm)</h6> <p>The back of your hand was hit, causing your fingers to spasm momentarily. Any weapon you’re holding in the associated hand is dropped (though if holding a weapon two-handed, you’re fine), and any seals you’re forming are automatically aborted. You take Needling 2, along with a -1 to Accuracy for the next 50 IC. Repeated applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to Accuracy, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has expired, re-apply it).</p> <h6 id="21---50-silhouette-torso">(21 - 50) Silhouette (Torso)</h6> <p>You’ve got a small but fairly deep incision from what struck you. The initial shock of pain was worse than the wound really is, though. You take Needling 2 and Stun 4, with the Stun increasing by 1 for every time you take this wound in the same battle.</p> <h6 id="51---80-flesh-wound-abdomen">(51 - 80) Flesh Wound (Abdomen)</h6> <p>You’ve been shanked in the gut. It managed to miss your vitals, but it’s still going to cause blood to trickle out of you. You take Needling 2, along with -1 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls.</p> <h6 id="81---100-muscle-stab-leg">(81 - 100) Muscle Stab (Leg)</h6> <p>They struck your quadricep, which is a fairly easy target, all things considered. If you spent the IC before you received this wound moving, you are inflicted with a Stun 8; whether you were moving or not, though, you take Needling 2 and have a -1 to Defensive rolls for the next 50 IC. Repeated applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to Defensive rolls, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has expired, re-apply it).</p> <h2 id="piercing-major">Piercing (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---20-joint-pierced-arm">(1 - 20) Joint Pierced (Arm)</h6> <p>One of your arm’s joints has been struck and is now filling with blood and becoming inflamed. It makes it much harder to properly manipulate the appendage, on top of the very strange and unnerving sensation you get when you move the arm and can feel the collected blood sloshing around. You’re inflicted with Needling 4, and take a -1 to Accuracy for (Needling Severity) * 10 IC anytime you’re inflicted by the Needling status (including this wound’s initial Needling). Repeated applications of this wound increase the duration, but not the Accuracy penalty (though you can have multiple accuracy penalties from this wound, with their durations tracked separately). This wound takes two weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="21---50-punctured-cavity-torso">(21 - 50) Punctured Cavity (Torso)</h6> <p>The body has several cavities, areas where specific internal organs are housed and kept together. One of them has been pierced and now has a hole in it, which is filling up with blood, inflicting Needling 4 and Stun 10. What’s worse is that every injury you take afterward causes your body to naturally tense up, aggravating the injury and causing noticeable pain, causing any future Needling status effect gained while you have this wound to also inflict an equivalent amount of Stun. It takes four weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="51---80-organ-hemorrhage-abdomen">(51 - 80) Organ Hemorrhage (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Your abdomen happens to have several internal organs all closely packed together. While space-saving, it also happens to mean that if you’re hit there, one of them is bound to be injured in some form or fashion, and that’s exactly what happened. What that boils down to is that you’re bleeding, a lot. You’re inflicted with Needling 4, and anytime you’re afflicted with Needling while you have this injury (including this Wound’s initial Needling), you take a 1+(Needling Severity)/2 penalty to Fatigue rolls. It takes three weeks to recover from, but only one with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="81---100-joint-pierced-leg">(81 - 100) Joint Pierced (Leg)</h6> <p>Though they missed fracturing your knee cap, they still managed to pierce the joint itself, and it’s now collecting (and leaking) blood which isn’t supposed to be there. Like many wounds, on its own it isn’t so bad, but when aggravated, it becomes very problematic. You’re inflicted with Needling 4, and take a -1 to all defensive rolls for (Needling Severity) * 10 IC anytime you’re inflicted by the Needling status (including this wound’s initial Needling). Repeated applications of this wound increase the duration, but not the defense penalty (though you can have multiple defense penalties from this wound, with their durations tracked separately). This wound takes two weeks to recover from.</p> <h2 id="piercing-severe">Piercing (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---20-tricep-tear-arm">(1 - 20) Tricep Tear (Arm)</h6> <p>They missed your humerus bone, but managed to pierce right through the tendon that connected a portion of your tricep to it. As any medically-savvy ninja knows, your tricep is pretty vital for doing things like holding objects, or punching. Most importantly, without a solid attachment to the muscle, it turns out your limbs are fairly useless, which is a problem for ninja who tend to employ violence. You’re inflicted with Needling 8, and your Damage Bonuses (both Ninjutsu and Physical) are reduced by 1 per rank of the jutsu you use (Basic Attacks are considered E-rank for this wound’s purposes). Tendons are tricky business, and require medical expertise to fix. Without medical attention, it won’t heal; with it, it takes five weeks.</p> <h6 id="21---50-rib-spearing-torso">(21 - 50) Rib Spearing (Torso)</h6> <p>The object that struck you did so in such a way as to cause your ribs not just to fracture, but to split entirely. Both ends are curved inward, making movement, breathing, and life in general incredibly painful. You’re inflicted with Needling 8, but that’s just the start of your problems: Every time you take an action with a Speed greater than (5 + RES/10), your own ribs stab into you from the exertion, and you take another Needling 2 status effect. Finally, the overall misery of being in constant pain makes it difficult for you to concentrate on anything other than the awful injury, and you take a -2 to all d20 rolls, which is doubled for Skills. This takes ten weeks to recover from, but will not heal without at least one week of medical treatment to align the broken rib(s) properly.</p> <h6 id="51---80-cavitation-abdomen">(51 - 80) Cavitation (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Cavitation is an interesting phenomena typically only created by high velocity projectiles. Ninja being ninja, of course, means that this could happen with even the most inconspicuous of objects. What Cavitation is, is basically a wave of pressure that forces things–in your case, your internal organs–to shift in location, causing a cavity where there was none. It results in your organs being crushed, missshapen, torn, and dislocated. This is especially problematic for the abdomen, wherein everything is already densely packed. There is, shall we say, a real estate issue.</p> <p>The end result is that you’re inflicted with Needling 8, and automatically advance a fatigue category. All status effects you’re afflicted with while you have this wound have their Severity increased by 1 automatically (including Needling). This takes twelve weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="81---100-hamstrung-leg">(81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)</h6> <p>Your hamstring got cut badly enough that it’s not doing its job any more. You can stand, barely, and you can balance, sort of, but the more you try to use it the worse off you’ll end up, and the searing pain going all the way up your leg is a very vivid warning of that. You’re inflicted with Needling 8, and for as long as you have this wound, track how many yards you move anytime you do so (Knockbacks, aerial flight and being carried by a Water Dragon Blast or Mud Wave don’t count, but Shunshin would), and every time you travel more than AGI/10 yards (cumulatively, even over multiple actions or movements while attacking), you take another Needling 1 status effect. Track how many times this effect has taken place while you’ve had the wound: until it heals, your Athletics rolls are penalized by that amount. This takes nine weeks to recover from.</p> <h2 id="piercing-critical">Piercing (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---20-shoulder-orifice-arm">(1 - 20) Shoulder Orifice (Arm)</h6> <p>Someone has created another orifice in your body. As in–if there wasn’t blood pouring out from both ends–someone could look right through your shoulder and see what’s out the other side. In Pain is an understatement. On top of that, your arm is pretty much worthless. It’s still there, but it’s not going to be doing you much good. You can’t wield two-handed weapons and take a Needling 16, for starters. On top of that, you have a -3 to Accuracy and a -6 to your Damage Bonuses. While you can use your hand still (and use the affected arm as a limb for grapple locks, still), it’s not particularly effective or fun, and you increase all Seal Speeds by 6. Finally, the fact that you have another hole in your body that isn’t meant to be there has done what puncture wounds usually don’t do, which is allow you to bleed freely: You take a Bleed 15 to top it all off.</p> <p>This won’t even begin healing until you’ve had four weeks of medical treatment. After that, it’ll take another six weeks of medical treatment, or twice as long resting the arm (you may fight and such, as long as you don’t use that arm) for it to heal fully.</p> <h6 id="21---50-punctured-lung-torso">(21 - 50) Punctured Lung (Torso)</h6> <p>Okay, so, first off, calm down. It’s not as bad as it… okay, yeah, it’s as bad as it sounds. The good news is, it’s not actually lethal. You’ve still got the other one (…right?) and whatever did this to you probably ventilated the lung, and by extension, the inside of your chest–no air building up in your chest cavity to collapse the other lung. …Ready for the bad news? Yeah, lungs aren’t actually meant to get ventilated. You have difficulty breathing, for one thing. In fact, you can’t actually breathe normally, because there’s an extra hole in your lung that disrupts the whole negative pressure system. Still, you’re a super awesome ninja, and as long as you have one hand free to cover the wound up, you can still breathe. Unfortunately, you’re inflicted with Needling 16, and can no longer Rest (Something about not being able to catch your breath..). Anyway, any sort of exertion will just make this problem worse for you: Any Action you take that has a Speed greater than your RES/10 inflicts you with a Needling 2 status effect, which compounds horribly with the fact that anytime you’re inflicted with the Needling status, you take a Stun of twice its severity, and gain both a Shock 1 and Paralysis 1 status effect that last until the Needling status effect fades.</p> <p>The ‘agonizing pain’ bit goes away in a month (or, more likely, you get used to it), but it it takes three months of medical treatment to recover from the effects. Once it’s done, you’re good as new.. Unless you get your second lung punctured before the first one’s healed. Then you begin to Suffocate, acquiring the status every 5 IC with every instance increasing the severity by one (Suffocate 1, then 5 IC later Suffocate 2, etc) and when your Suffocate status equals your RES/2, you just die.</p> <h6 id="51---80-pierced-liver-abdomen">(51 - 80) Pierced Liver (Abdomen)</h6> <p>You’re bleeding from the midsection, but the blood is black. Every ninja knows at least a little about anatomy, first aid, and injuries, but not all of them even know what it means, but you for sure know what it feels like: It feels like you’re bleeding from the liver and about to die. Which is pretty accurate, as your liver is meant to metabolize your body’s toxins, which are now leaking all over, inside and out. You’re inflicted with Needling 16, to start, and you automatically advance a fatigue category when you take this wound. Even worse, while you have this wound, your maximum Fatigue level is reduced by one (from Fatigue 6 to Fatigue 5, normally), meaning once you hit Fatigue 5, you go unconscious.. and you really, really don’t want to go unconscious, because the sickly looking blood you’re leaking will inflict you with Poison 1 20 IC later. And then increase to Poison 2, 20 IC after that. There is no maximum severity for this Poison, and its duration is as long as you have this wound.. so it’s going to be a while, unless you have a First Aid kit handy, which can be used to stop the Poison. However, so long as you have this wound, any time you advance a fatigue category, you are afflicted by a new Poison 1 status which continues to increase and must be treated all over again.</p> <p>This wound takes eighteen weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="81---100-penetrated-artery-leg">(81 - 100) Penetrated Artery (Leg)</h6> <p>Your femoral artery has been hit, and blood is literally spraying out of you into the air. Aside from the general pain involved and the fact that it’s completely disgusting, you’re losing a potentially fatal amount of blood and if it isn’t stopped–no, a hand and some pressure won’t stop this–you’re going to die. You’re inflicted by a Needling 16, though the real concern is how every action causes you to bleed out more, reducing your maximum Hit Points and current Vitality and HP by the Action’s (Speed + AP spent). If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you automatically fall unconscious (rather than becoming incapacitated). If your maximum Hit Points are reduced to 0, you bleed out and die.</p> <p>Recovery takes twelve weeks. At that point, you begin regaining lost maximum HP. Every week which passes you regain (RES)/2 max HP, or (RES) with medical attention. Once your max HP is fully restored, the wound goes away.</p> <h2 id="slashing-minor">Slashing (Minor)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-profuse-bleeding-head">(1 - 10) Profuse Bleeding (Head)</h6> <p>You got a gash on your face, maybe a slice into your cheek. You’re bleeding a lot! Head injuries are like that. The blood loss isn’t the issue; the fact that that blood is running over your face and getting in your mouth is. As your mouth fills with blood, it becomes progressively harder to breathe (and not vomit). You’re inflicted with a Bleed 2, +2 per time taken in the same battle, with a Suffocate 2 until the Bleed ends.</p> <h6 id="11---25-lacerated-arm">(11 - 25) Lacerated (Arm)</h6> <p>You got a nasty gash running along your arm. It didn’t cut anything vital, but blood is seeping down your arm and off your fingertips. All Seal Speeds are increased by 2 (unless you can do them one-handed, then you can avoid this by using the unwounded arm), and you have a -2 to all grapple checks.</p> <h6 id="26---55-armor-tear-torso">(26 - 55) Armor Tear (Torso)</h6> <p>Something managed to slice right across your chest, hacking your armor right off your body. On top of being a fairly nasty gash which is likely to scar if not given stitches, you have a Bleed 4 effect, and any armor you’re wearing is removed (But clothing is still there!). Armor which specifically applies to only a different location (such as your head) is not lost.</p> <h6 id="56---80-sliced-stomach-abdomen">(56 - 80) Sliced Stomach (Abdomen)</h6> <p>This is what happens when you can’t make your body concave enough. You get cut right across the belly. Fortunately it isn’t that bad, it’s just in a bad spot. Your Stamina and Chakra costs are all increased by 2 until the end of the battle.</p> <h6 id="81---100-lacerated-leg">(81 - 100) Lacerated (Leg)</h6> <p>You got a nasty gash running along your leg. It’s not life-threatening, but it is staining your clothes and oozing down your leg. You have a -1 immobilization penalty that will fade after 20 IC, but anytime you take a move action (moving as part of an attack action is fine, but using Shunshin is not), the wound will reopen, applying another -1 immobilization penalty with +5 IC in duration.</p> <h2 id="slashing-major">Slashing (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-blood-in-the-eyes-head">(1 - 10) Blood in the Eyes (Head)</h6> <p>Oh no you’re bleeding from the face! Because fights must be dramatic, the attack has cut in such as way (maybe right across your eyelid, maybe over the forehead) that blood is now dripping into your eyes, causing a continual distraction. You take a -1 Visibility Penalty every 20 IC in combat, stacking up to -5; taking this wound a second time causes the penalty to increase every 10 IC, and increases the cap to -10. You can take a Speed (Visibility Penalty)*2 action to wipe away the blood, resetting the penalty, but it won’t go away until treated with a first aid kit. This prevents you from accruing any Visibility Penalty from this wound in combat, but applies its own -3 Visibility Penalty as you have to cover the eye. This injury takes two weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="11---25-muscle-tear-arm">(11 - 25) Muscle Tear (Arm)</h6> <p>Your bicep and/or tricep have been partially torn, which tends to make it a lot harder to function effectively in combat, as your arm goes from a dry noodle to a limp one. Your STR is reduced by 15%. This affects everything derived from your STR score you’re hoping it doesn’t (PDB, Unarmed dice, Brute Force ranks, etc), with the exception of Willpower, Vitality, and Hit points: those are fine. This heals at a rate of 5% per two weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week in a hospital.</p> <h6 id="26---55-pulmonary-gash-chest">(26 - 55) Pulmonary Gash (Chest)</h6> <p>Something managed to cut through your pectoral muscle and between your ribs to nick your lung. A pretty impressive feat, but if they were a real badass they would get your heart (be sure to taunt them about that). This inflicts a Bleed effect of 2*Fatigue Level, minimum 2. Every time your fatigue level increases while you have this injury, you get a new Bleed effect based on your new Fatigue level. Luckily it’s a deep but narrow injury, so it tends to heal fairly quick. It takes two weeks to recover from, with or without treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-open-cavity-abdomen">(56 - 80) Open Cavity (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Your abdominal cavity–the part of your body that holds all your abdominal organs in together in a nice, safe environment–has been opened, and it really wasn’t meant to be. You can no longer Rest, and your bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls from your current Fatigue level are reduced by one (to become +4 per level, rather than +5). Taking this wound a second time (or more!) causes you to take an unreducable, unremovable penalty to Fatigue rolls of 2 per additional time this wound has been taken. This takes a month to heal.</p> <h6 id="81---100-muscle-tear-leg">(81 - 100) Muscle Tear (Leg)</h6> <p>Your quadriceps have been torn. Not to fear, the tendon is fine and you haven’t been hamstrung, but it’s still limiting in terms of how much you can use the muscle: Your AGI is reduced by 10%. This affects everything derived from your AGI score you’re hoping it doesn’t (Dodge, Initiative, max AP, movement speed). This heals at a rate of 5% per three weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week with medical treatment.</p> <h2 id="slashing-severe">Slashing (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-avulsed-ear-head">(1 - 10) Avulsed Ear (Head)</h6> <p>You have a nasty cut right across your ear! Not only does this look pretty brutal, but there’s blood seeping into your inner ear, which can do some nasty things to your sense of coordination. If you have the Enhanced Hearing ability, you lose all benefits from it, as well as any abilities which depend on it (such as Blind Fighting). With blood pooling in the ear making it difficult to keep your sense of balance, the highest level of Taijutsu you can perform is reduced by one (From A to B, B to C, C to D/etc).</p> <p>The blood can be drained from the ear easily with medical attention, but can’t be treated in battle. It will heal on its own (and probably scar) in eight weeks, or four weeks (and probably not scar) if you have medical attention.</p> <h6 id="11---25-hand-of-benediction-arm">(11 - 25) Hand of Benediction (Arm)</h6> <p>The median nerve around an elbow has been severed, resulting in a loss of proper hand function. It doesn’t hurt that much since it was a nerve that was struck, but your pinky and ring fingers are no longer able to be felt or manipulated at all, and your thumb is more or less unopposable. For starters, if you had anything in your hand at the time (evens for left, odds for right), you’re automatically disarmed. The same is true for any two-handed weapon you might be holding. You can not wield a weapon in that hand, and take a -3 to Accuracy rolls (even using your uninjured hand is more difficult by virtue of all your attacks coming from it), and all Seal Speeds are increased by 50% (unless you have Single-Handed Seals to avoid using the injured arm).</p> <p>This will not heal without treatment: Nerves are tricky things which require medical ninjutsu to properly restore. With medical attention, it takes five weeks to heal.</p> <h6 id="26---55-clavicle-cut-torso">(26 - 55) Clavicle Cut (Torso)</h6> <p>The horizontal bone that connects your sternum to your scapula has been fractured. More than likely, it’s possible you can even feel part of the bone that’s jutting out from the skin, if you try to look down at it. The worst part of it is the pain, which can’t really be avoided because of how the clavicle helps the scapula keep in position to let the arm hang. This inflicts a -2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, and a Paralysis 2 which does not reduce in severity until you recover. Any time you perform an action with a Fatigue cost, you take the action’s Fatigue cost in damage, which bypasses all reductions.</p> <p>Crash course in anatomy, you have two clavicles. If the result was odd, it’s your right; even, your left. With proper medical attention (a trip to a doctor, or a Medicine roll of 25 or higher using a First Aid kit, you or someone else) you can get the arm completely immobilized against your body. This reduces the Paralysis to 1, and prevents the damage taken from taking actions, but means you cannot use that arm or hand at all.</p> <p>It takes 6 weeks to heal, with or without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-chopped-liver-abdomen">(56 - 80) Chopped Liver (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Your liver has been cut. There’s really no good side to this one, it pretty much sucks. The liver happens to have quite a few functions, namely helping against toxins and the digestion of proteins. It’s kind of vital to live, and it happens to be bleeding out at a very significant rate. This applies a Bleed 10 effect, and if you’re under the effects of any type of Pill (Soldier, Blood, Akimichi, etc), they immediately end (including Soldier’s Fatigue level reduction, which can knock you unconscious as a result), and you can’t gain the benefits of any pills so long as you have this wound. Finally, the Severity of any poisons you suffer from while you have this wound are doubled, as your body can’t process the toxin.</p> <p>This takes ten weeks to recover from, down to five with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="81---100-hamstrung-leg-1">(81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)</h6> <p>One of the major tendons of the leg, located behind the femur, have been cut. You’re now unable to walk or stand properly, more or less, and running is completely out of the equation. You’re automatically knocked prone, and can no longer move when attacking. Your movement speed is reduced by 25%, and you take a -3 to all defensive rolls until this injury recovers.</p> <p>If you manage to survive the fight which caused this (props for that, since you’re a sitting duck), it takes twelve weeks to recover from, or six with medical attention.</p> <h2 id="slashing-critical">Slashing (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-cut-throat-head">(1 - 10) Cut Throat (Head)</h6> <p>The good news: you were not beheaded. The bad news: They didn’t fail by much. Your carotid artery was hit, along with your trachea, which means blood is flying all over the place and you’re going to suffocate from it if you don’t do something smart (like surrender, or run away). You start with a Suffocation 2. Every time you take an action with a Speed greater than 0, its severity is increased by 1 (notably, the “Move” action will not trigger this effect). However, instead of making a Stamina 15 roll every time your Suffocation increases (as you would with a normal Suffocation status), you make such a roll every 10 IC, which begins at Stamina 10 and increases by 1 each time. This follows all other normal rules for Suffocation. Additionally, you suffer a Bleed status with severity equal to that of the Suffocation. In the case of special abilities which reduce the effect of the Suffocation status on you, the Bleed’s Severity is determined before they’re applied. Treatment with a First Aid kit will set the Suffocation penalty to 0; however, this will not prevent it from increasing again. In fact, nothing will at all until you’ve recovered from the wound! Ouch. On the bright side, you’re a super implausible magic ninja. If you carefully apply pressure to your neck with both hands, you can temporarily suspend both the Suffocation rolls and the Bleed damage–though you may take no other actions while doing this, not even Speed 0 ones. This ‘suspension’ applies after you’ve been doing it for at least 10 consecutive IC.</p> <p>This is really just nasty business, all things considered. It won’t start healing until it’s received some medical treatment; after that, as long as you keep your neck bandaged and let yourself rest, it’ll take twenty-six weeks to heal, half that in a hospital.</p> <h6 id="11---25-avulsed-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Avulsed Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>Something just cut through a good portion of your arm. It’s still connected, but it’s kind of flopping, and you can’t really control it, and it’s kind of bleeding everywhere, and.. Yeah. Firstly, the arm is useless, which means you can’t hold weapons (any you are, drop), make handseals, use items and so forth. You take a Bleed 8, -4 to Accuracy and Grapples, and every time you perform an attack which deals damage, your Bleed status from this wound increases by your DB/4, minimum 1–if you had gotten rid of your Bleed status, then you acquire a brand new one!</p> <p>The arm will heal on its own so long as you keep it placed properly (any first aid kit will do for this) in a sling, reducing the penalty to Accuracy and Grapples by 1 per four weeks, two weeks if in the hospital. Once those penalties are gone entirely, you will stop incurring Bleed effects when you attack.</p> <h6 id="26---55-injured-spine-torso">(26 - 55) Injured Spine (Torso)</h6> <p>In simple terms, your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system and relays signals from the body to the brain, and vice versa. It also has several neural circuits which control numerous reflexes and “instinctual” actions that ninja tend to train themselves for (like moving out of the way of the technique that caused this). Fortunately for you, your reflexes didn’t seem to be that crucial anyway, since you let this happen, so you probably aren’t that bad off. Well, that’s a lie. Whenever you take an action with a Speed greater than (RES)/10, two things happen: The first is that you suffer a Shock of half its Speed for the next 10 IC. The second is that you acquire a Bleed 1 status, or increase your existing Bleed from this wound by 1. The Bleed from this wound lasts for the entirety of the combat and is not reduced by your RES/30 like normal bleeds (though other interactions and reductions work normally).</p> <p>This will not heal without medical treatment. It will take thirteen weeks of medical treatment to recover from this.</p> <h6 id="56---80-disemboweled-abdomen">(56 - 80) Disemboweled (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Congratulations, you’ve got what is potentially the most terrible injury one can receive. Your abdomen is full of all kinds of squishy organs and things which, as it turns out, are pretty important to keep you alive. Now there’s a giant cut across your midriff and they’re all trying to sag out of your body. Your Fatigue penalties are doubled, but the bonuses are not, and you can not maintain any jutsu with an Upkeep aside from Doujutsu. Until you’ve received treatment for this, any called shots to your abdomen automatically deal their damage to your Hit Points.</p> <p>It takes a total of twenty-four weeks of rest to recover from this, twelve if in the hospital. Every time you advance a Fatigue level after receiving this wound, it takes another week to recover from. The wound won’t even begin to heal until you’ve received some form of medical treatment (be it from a first aid kit or a week in the hospital).</p> <h6 id="81---100-achilles-tendon-cut-leg">(81 - 100) Achilles Tendon Cut (Leg)</h6> <p>Named after a mythic, nigh-invincible man who supposedly had a single tendon as his weak spot. As it turns out, that’s actually a weak spot of everybody, and you just found out first hand. The pain isn’t quite as bad as the sight of your foot dragging along unresponsively. For starters, you’re unable to really stand properly: You have an Immobilization penalty of 6, which does not fade over time. Additionally, you can’t use jutsu to move, or be moved by jutsu (such as Water Shark Blast, or Mud Wave), and if you suffer any sort of knockback, you’re automatically knocked prone. Because you’re essentially relying entirely on your good leg to get around, it’s incredibly difficult to adequately make bursts of speed and respond in the normal way that a shinobi would: Anytime you would spend 4 or less AP, you gain no effect from any of the AP spent. This does include passive effects which act like AP (such as Celerity) if they are 4 or less, though if you spend 5 or more AP, you gain the benefit of all AP utilized.</p> <p>This simply won’t heal without medical attention. With it, you reduce the Immobilization penalty every four weeks. Additionally, after eight weeks you are not longer knocked prone from Knockbacks, and can move and be moved by jutsu. After the the full twenty four week recovery time has passed, the AP limitation goes away.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
