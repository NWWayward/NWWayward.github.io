Rather than their differences opposing themselves, they use their differences to create obtuse ninshu and explore just how deep one’s connection to their heart and mind have with ninshu itself. To them, ethics was it’s own science, and they created bizarre experiments and spiritual beliefs to manipulate the evolution of their power.</p> <h2 id="aburame-moon">Aburame (Moon)</h2> <p>With the advanced evolution of Ninshu came innovative ways to study it even further. The Insects of the Aburame were used to track, absorb, and destroy chakra, and was one of the first available ways of doing so. Along with the Yamanaka, these two clans would act as the major defensive line of the Way of Sun and Moon and it’s secrets. They are known as the Moon of Truth.</p> <p><strong>Aburame begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <h4 id="-kikaichuu-no-jutsu--parasitic-destruction-insect-technique-">–( Kikaichuu no Jutsu – Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique )—</h4> <p>An ability exclusive to the Aburame, wherein they allow their own bodies to become a hive for the Kikaichuu.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 2</li> <li>Scale: 0</li> <li>Limit: 3+CHA/10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You gain a Swarm the first time this is taken, and add one to it for every rank after the first. As part of the cost of being a host of the Kikaichuu, you gain RES * 2 less to your Vitality, and RES less to your Hit Points (making them RES * 6+STR * 4 and RES * 2+CHA, respectively, before any Uniques).</p> <p>Kikaichuu can be commanded out to a maximum range of CHA*2 yards. Any further than that and you can no longer communicate with them and can only send them to places you know, and can only give them a single, basic command (“Go home and find Ino” would work, but “Search the town for anything suspicious” would not). They will complete it to the best of their ability and then return to you, but for every day in which they are beyond the listed range, its Swarm Size is reduced by one.</p> <p>Every Swarm deployed must have one Female Kikai with it (see below for acquiring Female Kikai), and the Female Kikai is only considered killed when the entire Swarm is destroyed. For every additional Female Kikai you have in a swarm past the first, that Swarm gains +1 to its Accuracy and any d20 rolls it makes, but extra Female Kikai are destroyed earlier, requiring at least two Swarm Size per Female Kikai. If you had 3 Female Kikai in a Size 5 swarm, the third would be destroyed if it was reduced to Size 4, and the second would be destroyed if it was reduced to Size 2.</p> <p>For every one Swarm Size, the Swarm has effectively CHA in Vitality. They do not actually lose Vitality though, instead they lose 1 Swarm Size for every (CHA) in damage they take from an attack. There’s no limit to this, but you always round down. If Shino had a Swarm Size 5 and 60 CHA, and someone did 298 damage to the Swarm, the Swarm would be reduced to Size 1, and any future attacks would require doing 60 damage to destroy the remaining Swarm Size, not 2.</p> <h4 id="--kikaichuu-swarms--">-=[ Kikaichuu Swarms ]=-</h4> <ul> <li>They use your Stats, Abilities, Uniques and Skills, but their effective Vitality never changes based on any of them (it is solely determined by the Swarm’s Size).</li> <li>They can’t block or parry; they dodge using CHA/10 (instead of AGI/10).</li> <li>AoE’s don’t penalize them based on movement, but they take a (Swarm Size) penalty to their dodge roll.</li> <li>They are immune to Burns, Bleeds, and Poisons.</li> <li>They are immune to Stuns, but are Stunned anytime you are.</li> <li>If the Aburame is ever Paralyzed or Shocked, their Swarm(s) are as well (but not vice-versa).</li> <li>They are immune to all effects based on the terrain (aka ‘Ground’ effects), Grapples, Wounds, and ignore Immobilization effects which work by restraining the target.</li> <li>For every 5 Ignite inflicted on the Swarm, they lose one Swarm Size immediately, but do not take damage over time from it (round down).</li> <li>Taijutsu which are not AoE do half damage to the swarm, and all Small weapons and Arrows reduce the Swarm Size by 1 less than they would normally (to a minimum of 0).</li> <li>They are immune to Genjutsu, but any Genjutsu affecting the Aburame affects their Swarms accordingly.</li> </ul> <p>Below are the basic ways in which you can use your swarm. In all cases, X is equal to the size of the swarm. If it ever becomes relevant, for every two Swarm Size, the Swarm’s effective rank increases (Size 1-2 is E, 3-4 is D, etc to a maximum of A), the Swarm uses your NDB when called for, and any Wounds the Swarm inflicts are considered Energy Wounds.</p> <p><em>Deploy (Speed X)</em> – This creates a cloud of Kikaichuu around you that extends X yard(s) out from you. You gain an upkeep equal to X/3 (round up). You can have multiple different swarms active, adding the size of all swarms together to determine your total Upkeep.<br> Tags: Preparation</p> <p><em>Return (Speed X/2 or +X/2, Interrupt)</em> – As long as you are within your swarm’s area, you can recall your deployed Kikaichuu. An Aburame may do this as an Interrupt to have them return to their body as they dodge an attack; a successful dodge means they return without being hit, while a failure means they are hit, and any remaining Swarm Size after the attack is resolved is returned to the Aburame.</p> <p><em>Dodge (Speed X/2, Interrupt)</em> – Your Swarm attempts to dodge an incoming attack. If you and the swarm must simultaneously dodge the same attack (from an Area of Effect attack, for example), then they dodge as part of your action, without having its own speed.</p> <p><em>Move (Speed Variable)</em> – Your Swarm moves, using your CHA in place of your AGI to determine its speed.</p> <p><em>Search (Speed 4)</em> – You use your bugs to assist you in finding something (or someone). You make an Awareness roll, with a +X bonus to the roll, maximum of CHA/20.</p> <p><em>Hide (Speed X or +X)</em> – You send your bugs out to hide, with a +5 bonus to their Stealth roll due to their size. You can choose to have your Swarm Hide when you first Deploy it by adding +X to the Speed of the Deploy action. Even if you have multiple Swarms each hiding, your Kikaichuu have a singular penalty to their Stealth rolls for every time they Hide in the same battle, even amongst different Swarms, tracked separately from your own penalty.</p> <p><em>Drain (Speed 10, Chakra 5+X)</em> – You send your Kikaichuu to bite and suck out the Chakra of someone. The target must be within the Swarm’s area or within the Swarm’s ability to move while attacking, as it is a melee range attack for the Swarm. This is considered a Ninjutsu attack, but deals no damage; if the Swarm hits, the target makes a Chakra Exhaustion 10+X roll, and then takes a penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to X/3. The penalty is cumulative with itself if the Swarm bites the same person, but is cleared when they advance a Fatigue Level as normal. Do note that the CE roll is made first, and any Fatigue advancement is done <em>before</em> applying the subsequent penalty to CE.</p> <p><em>Guard (Speed 6+X/2, Interrupt)</em> – You can use your Swarm to defend yourself or others that are within its area. Make a Dodge roll, with a bonus of X/2 to the roll. If you succeed, the attack is considered to have hit the Swarm instead, though the Swarm’s regular reduction for Taijutsu does not apply (non-AoE do not deal half damage and Small weapons and Arrows don’t reduce the Swarm by 1 less), as the Swarm is intentionally acting as a shield. If the Swarm’s Size is reduced to 0 by the damage of the attack, then you subtract from its damage the effective Vitality the Swarm had, and anything left over is dealt to the intended target. Partial Defense does not apply to the Swarm.</p> <h4 id="-fujin-kikaichuu--female-destruction-bugs-">–( Fujin Kikaichuu – Female Destruction Bugs )–</h4> <p>A special type of Kikaichuu responsible for reproduction and signaling, Female Kikaichuu are precious to the Aburame, who rely upon them to coordinate the masses of ordinary Kikaichuu.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base cost: 0</li> <li>Scale: 3</li> <li>Limit: CHA/20, Special</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You gain one Female Kikai every time you take this ability. You can not have more ranks in this ability than you have ranks in Kikaichuu no Jutsu.</p> <p>Female Kikai are required to deploy swarms, and have many uses to them, but the most basic use is to simply be a tracking beacon for the Aburame, who can sense its presence from afar and by association, someone whom the Female Kikai is hidden upon. To plant a Female Kikai outside of combat is typically an opposed Espionage roll, with a +5 bonus thanks to the bug’s size.</p> <p>In combat, you can attempt to plant a Female Kikai on someone anytime you make a melee-range attack, by increasing the attack’s speed by 4 (which does not increase its damage). If the action is successful, you also implant on the target a Female Kikai. This can be done when a Swarm attacks as well, but if it was the only Female Kikai in the Swarm, then the Swarm dissipates and the bugs scatter; you can recover the Swarm Size with a Return action, but the Swarm can take no actions itself. They get an Awareness roll versus the normal Stealth roll for Kikai hiding when it’s attached, but thereafter the female Kikai is considered to be in Stealth 3, and they typically have no reason to suspect its presence. It is a Speed 2 action for someone to crush a female kikai that they’ve found on themselves.</p> <p>For as long as the Female Kikai is attached, the Aburame has a +5 Awareness bonus against the person it’s attached to, any attacking Swarms have +3 Accuracy, and they’re always considered to be 1 Stealth level lower than they really are. If this would mean that they are not Stealthed at all, the Aburame can attack them with ranged attacks as normal, but can not attack with melee attacks (or have their clones do so), with the exception of using a Swarm’s Drain ability and the Insect Sphere jutsu.</p> <p>You can only attach a single Female Kikai to a person (attaching more gives no added benefit), but can have multiple Female Kikai placed on different people simultaneously. Deploying Female Kikai does not reduce the level of your Swarm Size, but it does limit how many Swarm Size you can recover via Insect Cocoon. Female Kikai are recovered naturally, at a rate of 1 + Max Willpower per day, so use them wisely.</p> <h4 id="-hijutsu-mushiyose--secret-technique-insect-gathering-">–( Hijutsu: Mushiyose – Secret Technique: Insect Gathering )–</h4> <p>By touching the ground and sending their chakra out in a web-like pattern, they can attract the attention of nearby insects to follow the chakra signal and come to the Aburame, which allows them to gain some basic information about an area.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: X</li> <li>Speed: X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Area: X * 5</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Any insects within (X * 5) yards are drawn to you, which you can then gather information from. Most insects are generally only concerned with very primitive things (eating, survival, and reproduction), and therefore are limited in what they may know, but will communicate what they can. Keep in mind this is not a capacity to <em>talk</em> to insects, merely communicate with them. X has a maximum of 10.</p> <h4 id="-hijutsu-mushimayu--secret-technique-insect-cocoon-">–( Hijutsu: Mushimayu – Secret Technique: Insect Cocoon )–</h4> <p>Since the Kikaichuu use their bodies as a nest and feed on Chakra, the Aburame can feed them even in the midst of battle to force a rapid reproduction, allowing more Kikai to be used if a large number happen to be destroyed.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: 5 + X + Y * 5</li> <li>Speed: 6 + X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 11</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You restore 1 Swarm Size per X; Y is the number of times you’ve used this jutsu this battle. As part of this jutsu you can also deploy (and hide, if you wish) the Swarm that you create. X is limited by the number of Female Kikai you have left alive and undeployed. You can not recover Female Kikai with this technique.</p> <h4 id="-hijutsu-mushidama--secret-technique-insect-sphere-">–( Hijutsu: Mushidama – Secret Technique: Insect Sphere )–</h4> <p>Using a Swarm that the Aburame has already spread out over an area in the battlefield and a Female Kikai’s trackability, the Aburame commands their Kikaichuu to harass and converge upon a single target. Unless they keep on the move, they will inevitably become swarmed by Kikaichuu that crawl up and all over their body, and attempts to run will have them continually chased by the Swarm.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutcu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 15 + X</li> <li>Upkeep: X/4</li> <li>Damage: (CHA/10)d(X)</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Deployed X Swarm Size, Female Kikai on target</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When you activate this jutsu, a deployed Swarm becomes single-mindedly focused on a singular enemy, and harasses them continuously. From then you track the Swarm individually, but the Swarm only takes a single action: Moving toward your designated target, which must have a Female Kikai upon them. If the Female Kikai is ever destroyed, this Jutsu ends automatically and the Swarm becomes a regular swarm on the battlefield. You can, at most once every 10 IC, spend AP to have the Swarm attack their target, assuming the Swarm is in melee range of them. You use your base Accuracy for Ninjutsu, unmodified by Status effects, Wounds, Temporary Bonuses, though penalties from Fatigue do apply.</p> <p>You can have the Swarm make a basic attack (dealing the listed damage above) for X/2 AP, or you can choose to have the Swarm perform any Grapple Jutsu you know of C-rank or lower, paying AP equal to its base Speed. So long as the Swarm is able to maintain melee range with their target, the Swarm is considered to be Grappling the target and in control. Rather than making Grapple rolls to escape, the Target must move far enough away to break melee range with the Swarm to be considered ‘free’ of the Grapple.</p> <p>The Swarm is immune to the Grappled condition itself, however, and both the Swarm and the Target do not have their Movement speed reduced for being in a Grapple (though the Target could still have their movement speed reduced from individual Grapple Jutsu, such as a Leg Lock), nor do they suffer the normal penalties associated with being Grappled; the Swarm merely gains the benefits of being considered in a Grapple with the target and in control if it’s beneficial for them. The sole exception to the above is that if they are using this special Grapple with someone who is suffering from an Ignite status, it harms the Swarm following normal Swarm rules and can reduce the Swarm’s size (potentially to 0, ending this jutsu) as a result. If a Grapple Check is ever required for a Grapple Jutsu they perform (such as from Tiger Drop), the Swarm uses your NDB in place of PDB. The Swarm is considered to have unlimited limbs.</p> <p>While this Jutsu is being maintained, the Swarm used in this Technique can not be used for any other action (drain, guard, creating clones, etc) until the technique is dismissed, though it can defend itself normally.</p> <h4 id="-mushi-jamingu-no-jutsu--bug-jamming-technique-">–( Mushi Jamingu no Jutsu – Bug Jamming Technique )–</h4> <p>The Aburame commands their Kikaichuu to disperse over a wide area of the battlefield and then transmits their Chakra to them, covering the field in chakra pathways. Depending on the whims of the Aburame, they can produce a variety of effects, from sensor disruption to draining an entire enemy squadron simultaneously.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 15 + X</li> <li>Speed: 10 + X</li> <li>Upkeep: X</li> <li>Area: X * 5</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: Deployed X Swarm Size</li> <li>Tags: Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create a cloud of Kikaichuu that turn into an Environmental effect, that can be used to do one of several things. You pick one from the list below when you first use this jutsu, and can switch between them as a Speed 4 + X action without repaying the cost, so long as the Upkeep is maintained.</p> <p>The Swarm used for this technique can not be used for anything else (drain, guard, creating clones, etc) until the technique is dismissed, and can not be targeted or attacked, nor do they take damage from area of effect attacks. You are immune to the penalties of this technique, but can benefit from its effects (when using Disrupt Chakra Sensors, namely), and can specify (Chakra Control Ranks)/5 additional people to be immune to Bug Jamming’s effects (chosen based on who is in the affected area at any given time).</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Disrupt Chakra Sensors</em> - While maintaining the field, you take no penalty for the upkeep of your Kikaichuu (or this technique) when someone tries to sense or spot you, and instead have a bonus to of X to disguise and/or hide yourself from attempts to detect you via Chakra (namely a Chakra Sensor’s Scan, and a Natural Chakra user’s A Dream of the World, though in the latter case, it does not prevent you from detecting your overall presence). Those able to identify individual chakra signaturs are unable to do so for anyone within the field.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Obstruct Vision</em> - By constantly keeping in motion and following a synchronized pattern, the beetles can obstruct anyone’s vision who is within the field. While not an actual hindrance to movement, they impose a -X Visibility Penalty to anyone inside of it, or anyone attacking into the field, for as long as it’s maintained. If this technique has its visibility penalty reduced by other jutsu (such as by the E-rank Fuuton, Cleansing Winds) then it regains 1 point of its penalty every 5 IC that pass, so long as you maintain its Upkeep. On the other hand, effects which remove it entirely (such as the A-rank Fuuton, The North Wind) will, indeed, remove it (and end the Upkeep automatically).</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Chakra Drain</em> - Anyone inside of the field who makes a Chakra Exhaustion roll while within the field takes a penalty to their roll equal to X, which persists until they leave the field. Unlike normal penalties to Fatigue, it does not go away when you advance a Fatigue level: You must leave the area to get rid of the penalty.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="-mushi-bunshin--bug-clone-">–( Mushi Bunshin – Bug Clone )–</h4> <p>Using thousands of Kikaichuu, the Aburame creates a replica of themselves made out of their bugs. While it isn’t capable of taking damage well, the clone can utilize the Aburame’s chakra and jutsu, making it a powerful tool.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Chakra: 14 + Y * 3</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Special: X Swarm Size, Y Willpower, Y Female Kikai</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create Y clone(s) of yourself (Max 2), dedicating one or more ranks of your Swarm Size to each clone. Your clones inherit all the properties of a normal swarm. X is equal to the Swarm Size dedicated to each clone (and thus can be different per clone), and has a minimum of Y, as each clone must have one Swarm Size.</p> <p>Once the Swarm Size used to make a clone is reduced to 0, the clone is destroyed (as is the Female Kikai). You can voluntarily dismiss any clones as a Speed X + Y * 2 action to turn one or more clones back into regular Swarm(s), but you can never regain any Willpower spent on creating Mushi Bunshin. The Swarm Size used to create these clones reduces your current and maximum Swarm Size (you can’t ‘replace’ swarm size for this jutsu with Insect Cocoon).</p> <p>These clones can perform any jutsu you know, but have no chakra of their own, and you pay any costs (CE, Stamina, Upkeeps) associated with their actions. They act only when you spend AP for them to do so, and can’t act again until an IC has passed equal to the speed of their action. You may hide amongst your clones (and others may Observe them) as normal, but if they act or react in a way that makes it obvious they’re bugs (such as taking less damage from a Taijutsu attack, or being immune to grapples or various status effects), it’s obvious they’re a clone.</p> <p>Bug Clones can attempt basic dodges and parries, along with the following actions:</p> <p><strong>Basic Attack [Variable AP]</strong> - The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, paying 1 AP per X speed of that action.<br> <strong>Jutsu [Variable AP]</strong> - The clone can perform any Jutsu you know, paying 1 AP per X speed of that action. It uses your DEX to determine Seal Speeds, which have to be paid for by AP as well.</p> <h2 id="hyuuga-sun-noble">Hyuuga (Sun, Noble)</h2> <p>The first few who awakened the Byakugan down Hamura’s family tree, were the noble leaders of the clan and were the original founders of the Way of Sun and Moon. Especially due to the Pride wanting to take the Hyuuga’s eyes for themselves in the early stages of the war. They quickly allied with a fellow victim of eye prey, the Uchiha. Together, the two clans would evolve and develop ninshu to become an illusive force of balance. The Hyuuga used their eyes to guide people towards the truth of understanding ninshu and it’s evolution.</p> <p><strong>Hyuuga begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <h4 id="--byakugan--white-eye--">-=[ Byakugan – White Eye ]=-</h4> <p>Activating Byakugan is a Speed 0, Seal Speed 6 action which, once you can reduce its Seal Speed to 0, you no longer need to perform handseals to activate it. You can activate Byakugan when rolling Initiative with the Preparation ability. Byakugan has an Upkeep of 2, grants +5 to Awareness rolls, and while active, anyone Hidden (or who attempts to Hide) within Byakugan’s range is automatically spotted if their Stealth TN is lower than your total bonus to Awareness (without the normal 1d20, or anything in place of it).</p> <p>You can differentiate between people and clones (except for Kage Bunshin), and can tell if someone is using Henge (though this does not allow you to see their true form).</p> <p>Byakugan allows you to see through physical objects (though you’re still aware of their presence), giving you (in crude terms) “X-ray vision”, except you see Chakra instead of bones and dense objects. You can see everything in a CHA yard radius around you this way. This allows you to spot jutsu-based traps and effects, and detect the presence of Fuinjutsu placed on a person, item, or area. When actively searching for an opponent in combat, you double Byakugan’s normal Awareness bonus.</p> <p>Finally, you are immune to all Visibility Penalties from external sources, such as blindfolds, ninjutsu-induced mists, and bombs. You are immune to Genjutsu which target an area instead of people, can automatically see through them as if they weren’t there, and can tell when someone else (not yourself) is being affected by a Genjutsu (of any kind) from the disturbance in their chakra flow.</p> <h4 id="-jyuuken--gentle-fist-">–( Jyuuken – Gentle Fist )–</h4> <p>The Hyuuga’s signature fighting style which makes use of Byakugun’s ability to see an opponent’s chakra flow alongside graceful taijutsu strikes. With every contact the Hyuuga injects small bursts of chakra into calculated points within the opponent’s chakra flow, sealing them off and damaging internal organs directly. Save for unique physiology or other abilities, Jyuuken is notoriously difficult to defend against once contact is made.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Taijutsu, Rank E</li> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Damage: (CHA/10)d4</li> <li>Special: Opener</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Jyuuken uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, instead of your Physical Damage Bonus. Its damage cannot be blocked, Ignores Armor, and bypasses DR. Every time you hit someone with Jyuuken, you inflict Sealed Tenketsu 1, or increase their existing Sealed Tenketsu status by one (if they already have the Status effect). Jyuuken inflicts Energy Wounds.</p> <p>When used as an Opener, Jyuuken allows you to convert any subsequent Combo jutsu you use into a Jyuuken variant without paying the normal +5 Chakra cost (but you gain all the other effects listed below, as normal for a Jyuuken conversion), for that duration of that Combo.</p> <p>In addition to the above attack, once you learn this jutsu, you can use Jyuuken to convert any Unarmed or Combo Taijutsu into a Jyuuken variation, applying the following effects:</p> <ul> <li>The Stamina Cost is replaced with a Chakra Cost, +5 (if it has both, add them together as a singular Chakra cost, without adding the normal +5).</li> <li>Blocking’s effectiveness is reduced by 25%.</li> <li>It ignores armor, and bypasses half of an opponent’s DR.</li> <li>It uses your NDB in place of PDB, CHA in place of STR, and DEX in place of RES wherever applicable.</li> <li>On hit, inflict Sealed Tenketsu 1 per Rank of the Jutsu (E = 1, D = 2, C = 3, etc).</li> <li>In the case of Combos, you can not switch from a regular Combo to a Jyuuken Combo, with the sole exception that you may go from an ordinary Opener into a Jyuuken Combo, and you use Jyuuken’s damage as your Basic Unarmed Attack damage.</li> <li>Any Wounds dealt are Energy Wounds, instead of normal.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-hakke-kuushou--eight-trigrams-empty-palm-">–( Hakke Kuushou – Eight Trigrams Empty Palm )–</h4> <p>One offensive counterpart to the defensive Hakkeshou Kaiten. Rather than releasing chakra from all tenketsu to form a protective barrier, chakra is released from certain tenketsu, typically the forearm and palm, to create a forceful thrust, which damages an opponent at a distance.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Taijutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: +5</li> <li>Range: CHA/4</li> <li>Speed: +2</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is added to any Jyuuken or Jyuuken-converted Unarmed or Combo attack, increasing its Chakra cost and Speed accordingly (though its damage does not increase). It allows those techniques to be performed at the listed range (and, accordingly, does not break combos). Because this changes the technique into what is essentially a wave of force, it prevents them from being parried as a normal Unarmed Taijutsu, and converts them (for the purposes of defending against them) into being considered Ranged Ninjutsu Projectiles, as it is essentially a wave of force. It cannot, however, be used to extend the range of the various Gentle Fist finishers.</p> <h4 id="-hakkeshou-kaiten--eight-trigrams-palm-revolving-heaven-">–( Hakkeshou Kaiten – Eight Trigrams Palm Revolving Heaven )–</h4> <p>The absolute defense of the Hyuuga clan, to use this technique the Hyuuga simultaneously releases chakra from every tenketsu in their body and begins spinning rapidly. The combined effect is to generate a virtually impervious shield of rotating chakra; what makes it truly effective is that the chakra used won’t dissipate until the user finally comes to a stop.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Taijutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Stamina: 5 + X</li> <li>Chakra: 5 + X</li> <li>Damage: (CHA/10)d4</li> <li>Area: CHA/10</li> <li>Speed: 6 + X</li> <li>Special: Interrupt, Abort</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Kaiten’s final Speed my never go below its base Speed, and it always uses its base Speed for its damage (i.e., X does not add to NDB * Spd for damage). If used as an Interrupt, you make an Accuracy Roll with a +X/2 bonus against all attacks directed at you that IC; failure means you are hit, but activate Kaiten immediately afterwards. Kaiten deals Energy wounds.</p> <p>Kaiten lasts for its full Speed in IC after being used. For example, if you used it on IC 22 when attacked, paying 8 Chakra and Stamina, it would last until IC (22+6+3) = 31. Anytime after the first 6 IC have passed (on IC 28), you may abort Kaiten.</p> <p>Kaiten flawlessly deflects any Ninjutsu (including Area of Effect Ninjutsu) or Taijutsu while you are spinning. Though it can not be used to interrupt Genjutsu, you cannot be targeted by them while Kaiten is in progress.</p> <p>Anyone within Kaiten’s Area when it’s activated must defend against it as an area of effect ninjutsu attack, and those who fail are moved to the edge of its Area. If Kaiten is activated inside of a persistent AoE effect (such as a cloud, or water slick) with an area equal to or less than its own, Kaiten ends that effect.</p> <p>This technique’s only true weakness is that it is ineffective if the user cannot spin: If you are suffering from a -5 or greater Immobilization Penalty, you may not utilize Kaiten.</p> <h4 id="-juukenpo-ichigekishin--gentle-fist-art-one-blow-body-">–( Juukenpo Ichigekishin – Gentle Fist Art One Blow Body )–</h4> <p>Another offensive use of the Hyuuga’s ability to release chakra from his tenketsu. Here a force is created and directed against an opponent, or even against the espied weakness of some technique in order to dispel it, using the Byakugan’s ability to see chakra. In either case, the force created can easily send most opponents flying.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Taijutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 10 + X</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan Active</li> </ul> <p>EffectS: If used in a grapple, make a grapple check against those grappling you, using your NDB in place of PDB; X is how much, if any, you fail the roll by. The grapple immediately ends, and you attack your grappler with Jyuuken at the same time (though it is defended against at its normal Speed, which can be reduced by AP, if you wish). If they take any damage from the attack, they’re knocked back CHA/15 yards away from you.</p> <p>You can also use this Jutsu to end any effect which restrains you externally, from being tied up with ropes, to being trapped inside a Water Prison, or Immobilized by a Clay Bullet. If used against a Jutsu, X is that technique’s Upkeep (if it has one) or Immobilization penalty (if it has both, use the higher of the two). Otherwise, X is zero.</p> <h4 id="-hakke-rokujuyon-shou--eight-trigrams-sixty-four-palms-">–( Hakke Rokujuyon Shou – Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms )–</h4> <p>A devastating series of Jyuuken strikes carried out in rapid succession, sealing many of an opponent’s Tenketsu in the process. The strikes are made in increasing powers of two: two strikes, followed by another two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two, for a total of sixty-four strikes. The damage to internal organs and chakra flow is often so debilitating that the victim can no longer stand.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Combo Taijutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: (12 + CHA/4)d4</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Special: Finisher</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan active</li> <li>Combo Bonus: +4d4 damage, +2 Stun, +1 Sealed Tenketsu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This attack uses your NDB and inflicts Sealed Tenketsu 3, reduces Blocking’s effectiveness by 25%, ignores armor, bypasses half of an opponent’s DR, and deals Energy wounds. This attack may not be converted with Jyuuken.</p> <h4 id="-hakke-hyaku-nijuuhachi-shou--eight-trigrams-one-hundred-twenty-eight-palms-">–( Hakke Hyaku Nijuuhachi Shou – Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms )–</h4> <p>The ultimate and most lethal usage of Jyuuken, and the final development of Hakke Rokujuyon Shou. The Hyuuga’s speed and chakra control have reached truly amazing levels, adding a seventh series of strikes which doubles the number of strikes made from sixty-four to one hundred twenty-eight.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Combo Taijutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Stamina: 35</li> <li>Damage: (28 + CHA/4)d4</li> <li>Special: Finisher</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: Byakugan Active</li> <li>Combo Bonus: +8d4 damage, +2 Sealed Tenketsu, +1 Immobilize</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This attack uses your NDB and inflicts Sealed Tenketsu 4, reduces Blocking’s effectiveness by 25%, ignores armor, bypasses half of an opponent’s DR, and deals Energy wounds. This attack may not be converted with Jyuuken.</p> <h6 id="--sealed-tenketsu--">-=[ Sealed Tenketsu ]=-</h6> <p>This is a Status Effect, applied on hit, that penalizes Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls equal to its Severity, and half that (rounding down) to Stamina rolls. If you ever fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll while you have this status, whatever action you were trying to do fails (but you advance in Fatigue as normal), and you lose Hit Points (not Vitality) equal to the Chakra cost of that technique.</p> <p>Sealed Tenketsu stacks partially with itself. If you already have the status applied, and are struck by another attack which it inflicts it, add half (rounded down) the lower severity to the higher; this is the new severity of your Sealed Tenketsu status. For example, if you were at 3, then hit by an attack which inflicted Sealed Tenketsu 5, your status would be (5 + 3/2) = (5 + 1) = 6. Another attack with ST 3 would, then, raise you to 7.</p> <p>A victim’s body naturally will try to correct its chakra flow to meet demands in battle: Every time someone with this status takes the Rest action it reduces by 1, and when they advance in Fatigue, they lower their Sealed Tenketsu Severity by their (Chakra Control Ranks)/5, minimum 1. Outside of combat, Sealed Tenketsu is reduced by the same (Chakra Control Ranks)/5, minimum 1, every hour.</p> <h2 id="juugo-suto-sun">Juugo Suto (Sun)</h2> <p>Just being a part of the Way of Sun and Moon led to individuals who trained themselves further in the understanding of Ninshu and not only how to use it, but how to survive it. These survivors were the natives of the Valley of Lost. People who wanted to remain secluded from the war and live as nomads in a barren land where no settlement would want to be. The Way of Sun and Moon found this place to be best for their operations and invited the natives to join them in their mission for a better future. The natives, already having the war bring brought to them, decided to make fast friends.</p> <p><strong>Juugo Suto have +5% Bonus XP.</strong></p> <h4 id="--survival-instinct--">-=[ Survival Instinct ]=-</h4> <p>Most clans pass on secret techniques as a rite of passage. The Juugo Suto have a somewhat different rite: once a member is ready they are left alone, in the middle of the desert, without provisions or equipment, and told not to return for at least a month; most of them aren’t even teenagers. It’s a testament to the clan that virtually every student is, in fact, ready to undertake this challenge, and returns safely to the village. It’s a testament to the ordeal that they inevitably return from their journey changed: quieter, calmer, and infinitely more aware of the world around them.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 25</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You are immune to surprise attacks. Attacks which would normally not end an opponent’s stealth still do not do so, but they receive none of the benefits of surprise attacks against you. Sneak attacks against you instead follow the normal rules for surprise attacks.</p> <h4 id="--tenacity--">-=[ Tenacity ]=-</h4> <p>Desert is some of the most difficult terrain to navigate, but the sand foxes do it.

This does not change the actual severity of the status you are affected by (for things such as Hiding if you are suffering from a -6 or higher Visibility status effect).</p> <p>Additionally, you reduce the maximum Immobility Penalty you can suffer from by 2, plus 1 per rank after the first.</p> <p>The reductions to penalties is applied after determining the maximum Severity you can be affected by (from this ability and other effect which modifies the maximum severity you can suffer from either status effect).</p> <h4 id="--desert-ghosts--">-=[ Desert Ghosts ]=-</h4> <p>In the world of shinobi, there is no such thing as hunter and hunted; one is both, at all times. The Juugo Suto are preeminently aware of this.

If you are leading a group with a size of your (Survival Ranks/5) or less (including you), you may make a single Survival roll for all members, and anyone trying to track the group receives a -1 penalty per rank to their roll. Multiple Sand Foxes may work together, pooling their Survival skills for the maximum size, and using only the highest roll and penalty.</p> <h4 id="--intuition--">-=[ Intuition ]=-</h4> <p>There are multiple sayings in Sand about a sand fox’s intuition. Some are jokes at their expense, often told by genin. And the clan bears them without comment, because among the jounin those sayings are proverbs.</p> <p>It’s not, despite what some have speculated, anything supernatural. The juugo suto can’t actually watch every leaf in a forest at once, or hear a feather falling. All they can do, and all they need to do, is be calm, and watch, and listen, and know what about a setting is just a little bit wrong.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 50</li> <li>Requires: 20 Awareness, 20 Survival</li> </ul> <p>Effects: All enemies are treated as being 1 Stealth category lower than they actually are, to you; this mainly applies for reducing their Stealth bonus when you’re looking for them.</p> <p>This does allow you to attack an enemy in Stealth 1, though you may do so only with ranged attacks, and then at a -3 penalty to Accuracy–you’re going by intuition, and essentially firing blind. Area-of-effect attacks do not suffer from this Accuracy penalty. Similarly, you are inherently aware of the presence (though not location) of anyone only in Stealth 1– they can’t sneak up on you.</p> <h2 id="nara-moon">Nara (Moon)</h2> <p>The Nara clan were one of the lasts to join the Way of Sun and Moon. They are mostly known for involvement with the Kagefumi, a criminal organization that specialized in capturing targets and holding them ransom.

You gain control over your target’s actions, and while you maintain this jutsu’s Upkeep, they can take no action which requires physical movement or control of their own body (including, and up to, being unable to Rest), save for talking; however, your target can try to resist your control.</p> <p>While caught, the following effects apply:</p> <ul> <li>They can not move, however if you move, they move in a way that is mirrored to you; if you move toward them, they move toward you. If you turn left, they turn right, etc. However, if you move (or are forced to move) away from them beyond double this jutsu’s range, your shadow is severed from them and this jutsu ends.</li> <li>They can not take actions, but you can make them perform any Taijutsu which you know, use any weapon or item they have, and any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu which you both know. You can make them perform any mundane task, including forcing them to disarm themselves. They pay the Fatigue costs for any actions you make them perform, though you must perform the same action. If you make them perform an attack, their attack uses your Accuracy, rather than their own.</li> <li>If you attack them, they use the same attack against you, though you can use a Large weapon to attack them without being hit if they have a non-Large weapon (or none), and any non-Small weapon to attack without being hit if they have a Small weapon (or none). You can perform any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu you know against them, though if they know the same technique, they perform it as well, directed at you.</li> <li>You can also attack someone else and make them attack the same target as you, at the same time, with a -3 to their Accuracy.</li> <li>Anytime you make them perform an action, your IC is advanced by the appropriate amount, and theirs is not.</li> <li>Anytime someone you’re controlling is attacked, you can partially relax the technique long enough for them to defend themselves at a -2 to their defensive roll, or hold them in place as they are attacked: while they still get to defend against the attack, they instead take a -10 to their defensive roll, and have block’s effectiveness reduced by 50%, in addition to being anchored to the spot, unable to move (As it relates to area of effect penalties). If held in place, after the attack is resolved they automatically break free of this technique.</li> <li>Anyone caught by this technique can, as a Speed 10, Stamina 5 action, attempt to break free as a Grapple Check, rolling as the defender in a Grapple. You use your NDB in place of PDB, with a +X bonus; X has a maximum of your NDB rounded down.

If you then hit, you deal no damage or effects based on the original attack (you still missed), but you apply a -2 Immobilization Penalty to your intended target as you attach the thrown weapon’s shadow to theirs.</p> <p>They are then anchored to the thrown weapon (which is assumed to have landed at their feet), and to free themselves (and end the Immobilization) they must wrestle free as a Speed 6 action, rolling a Grapple Check (as the defender) against you (as the attacker), with you using your NDB in place of PDB, with a bonus to your NDB of however much you hit by. They take a penalty to their grapple roll equal to the Immobility penalty from this technique. A successful grapple check by someone anchored by this technique completely clears their Immobility penalty. Alternatively, they can just move far enough away from the anchor point that the shadow breaks, reducing the penalty by 1 every ten yards away from the anchor point they move.</p> <p>If used on a target already anchored by this jutsu’s effect, you can choose to make use of it on someone even if you hit them with a thrown ranged weapon attack, and the Immobility Penalty stacks with itself, to a maximum of -6.</p> <h4 id="-kage-kubishibari-no-jutsu---shadow-neck-binding-technique-">–( Kage-Kubishibari no Jutsu - Shadow-Neck Binding Technique )–</h4> <p>Using the Nara’s connection to someone else’s shadow, they use their shadow control to expand a tendril of shadow up to a target’s neck, typically taking the shape of actual hands and fingers, to strangle and injure someone they have caught.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 17</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Suffocate 1</li> <li>Requires: Target currently controlled by Kagemane no Jutsu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique does not require an Accuracy roll, and its target does not get any defense against it, nor does it provoke a free escape roll from Kagemane. Consecutive use of this Jutsu (i.e., taking no non-interrupt actions between uses) reduces its Chakra Cost and Speed by 1, to a minimum of Chakra 10 and Speed 7.</p> <p>Each time you use this Jutsu, roll 1d100+CHA/4+Any % bonuses to Wounds you might have as a flat addition. (i.e., Killer’s +20% wounding would turn into a flat +20 to the roll).

There are very few Niou; rather than trying to generate a reputation that would have shinobi around the world terrified of their prowess, they downplay and obfuscate their abilities.</p> <p>Their ‘invisibility’ is most frequently dismissed as more Mist ninja trickery, hiding behind veils of chakra-enhanced fog and ninjutsu. The Niou are happy to keep things that way, and their village quietly encourages this subterfuge. Even within Kirigakure, the Niou are few enough in number to be passed off as just a large extended family, not an actual ninja clan. Niou tend to prefer to adopt in to their clan, and many of these orphans keep their original name, rather than take the clan’s. They may pride themselves on membership, but possessing a different last name makes it that much harder for another shinobi to connect the dots.</p> <p>Despite their outward appearance of being largely disconnected, Niou tend to have a close-knit companionship with each other, a mutual respect that transcends personal grudges. They are raised to be quietly but firmly loyal to their clan and village, and to prefer reserved confidence over boastful ambition.</p> <p>Niou frequently gather together to brag of their exploits to one another, simply to avoid doing so to other members of the village, who may not fully understand their invisibility technique–everybody likes to brag, after all.</p> <h4 id="-genshin-no-jutsu---invisibility-technique-">–( Genshin no Jutsu - Invisibility Technique )–</h4> <p>The pride of the clan, and their most closely guarded secret. This technique wraps the user in a layer of chakra, and projects their surroundings across their skin. A slight distortion is the only indication that anything is out of the ordinary, the technique even providing the illusion of distance.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You become invisible. While invisible, you may take the Hide action without needing to fulfill its normal requirements, with a +5 bonus; while hidden, you are always considered to be one Stealth category higher than you actually are. When making a Stealth roll, or an Espionage roll to be unnoticed (such as pilfering something, or picking a pocket) you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) instead of 1d20. Those Espionage rolls also receive a +5 bonus.</p> <p>Your Dodge rolls receive a similar benefit: you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20. This doesn’t apply against area-of-effect techniques.</p> <p>You lose all of the above benefits against those that can see Chakra (i.e., against activated Doujutsu, which is normally limited to Hyuuga and Uchiha), and are instead considered to be one Stealth category lower than you actually are against them while you maintain this technique.</p> <h5 id="--maboroshi-no-jutsu---phantom-technique--">-=[ Maboroshi no Jutsu - Phantom Technique ]=-</h5> <p>You project your chakra over another person, granting them invisibility as well. This requires you to make physical contact with them when it’s first applied, and they must remain within (CHA/5) yards for its effects to persist.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 10</li> <li>Scale: 5</li> <li>Limit: CHA/40</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can conceal one additional person, or person-sized object, with Genshin no Jutsu per Rank. This requires Genshin to be active on yourself, and each additional person or object concealed this way increases its Upkeep by 2. People and objects concealed this way may use your Stealth roll in place of their own; if you’re hiding a group, you make only a single Stealth roll for the entire group.</p> <h4 id="-meimei-arashi---invisible-tempest-">–( Meimei Arashi - Invisible Tempest )–</h4> <p>Wrapping a weapon or held object in your chakra-induced veil of invisibility is easy; unfortunately, that does not extend to thrown weapons, as their invisibility comes to an end as soon as they leave your grasp. This technique exists specifically to patch that hole in the Niou’s invisibility: it allows you to veil one or more thrown weapons in your chakra, keeping them unseen until they’ve struck their target.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: Special</li> <li>Requires: Genshin no Jutsu active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This supplements a throwing or multi-throw attack by making it an automatic surprise attack. Its Chakra cost is equal to half of the technique’s Stamina cost. If used while hidden, this reduces your Stealth TN by only 2 each time it’s used.</p> <h2 id="uchiha-moon-noble">Uchiha (Moon, Noble)</h2> <p>Much like the warring states era of the before-time, the Uchiha were a powerful clan that demanded respect from those that would oppose it. Only this time, they had friends. The Hyuuga allied with the Uchiha to protect the knowledge and research of their Dojutsu. They were the part of the original founding of the Way of Sun and Moon. With that, it was as if Hamura and Hagoromo reunited once more.</p> <p><strong>Uchiha begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <p>Outside of their normal training, all members of the Uchiha clan are taught how to use Katon ninjutsu while growing up. Accordingly, they start with the Elemental Aptitude ability for Fire, for free.</p> <h4 id="--sharingan---copy-wheel-eye--">-=[ Sharingan - Copy Wheel Eye ]=-</h4> <p>Sharingan is a doujutsu, or ‘eye technique’; when it manifests, the user’s irises turn red, and a tomoe (essentially a comma-shaped mark) appears in the iris, like a second pupil. Another tomoe appears in each eye at the second and third stages, for a maximum of three.</p> <p>The Sharingan’s greatest weakness is that it is dependent upon unimpeded visibility: None of the abilities provided by it may be used when you’re at a Visibility Penalty of -6 or greater.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the Uchiha, they are not inherently able to access this power. Rather, in times of need—generally when under severe combat-related stress—the doujutsu will activate itself. This is GM-regulated; you’ll be informed if this takes place. When it does, your Sharingan immediately activates at the stage above the highest you’ve achieved, and from then on you may activate that stage at will.</p> <p>PC Uchiha are considered better than your average Uchiha and begin with Stage 1 unlocked at creation. Unfortunately, to unlock its higher stages requires training and persistence. A shinobi can unlock the Sharingan’s higher stages without the need for external stimulus, though it can take a while. 500 XP above your starting XP (the total amount you have when you get your character approved), you unlock Stage 2. 1500 XP above your starting XP, you unlock Stage 3. Legends speak of a fourth, higher stage, but no one in recent memory has obtained it.</p> <p>Activating Sharingan is a Speed 0 action, which can be performed by itself, or alongside another technique or Interrupt, and it has an Upkeep of 2. You can activate Sharingan when rolling Initiative with the Preparation ability.</p> <p>Techniques unlocked at the various Sharingan levels (detailed in their respective Stage section, below) can be acquired automatically, as soon as you unlock the Stage that grants them. They have no rank or skill requirements to learn, and you can go into ‘XP debt’ by acquiring them, though all XP you earn goes to paying the costs of such techniques before you can spend XP on anything else until they’re paid for.</p> <h6 id="--sharingan-stage-1--">-=[ Sharingan, Stage 1 ]=-</h6> <p>At the first stage, you are able to acquire the Dousatsugan and Saimingan techniques. Both are learned as D-rank jutsu.</p> <h6 id="--sharingan-stage-2--">-=[ Sharingan, Stage 2 ]=-</h6> <p>The second stage adds a second tomoe to each eye, and is when the bulk of the doujutsu’s power begins to manifest. Their ability to copy techniques and actions becomes refined, to the level of being able to extrapolate from fine details and mimic even small mannerisms.</p> <p>You may obtain Yogengan and Shouningan. Both are learned as C-rank jutsu. You also gain a +1 to all Skill rolls while Sharingan is active.</p> <h6 id="--sharingan-stage-3--">-=[ Sharingan, Stage 3 ]=-</h6> <p>The final tomoe appears at this stage, with the trio forming a ring halfway between the pupil and the rim of the iris, equidistant from one another. Upon reaching this stage, you can copy any Genjutsu used upon you by another Uchiha with their Eye of Hypnotism power, despite its lack of handseals (again, assuming you meet the proper requirements).</p> <p>You may obtain Magen: Kyouten Chiten and Senchigan. Both are learned as B-rank techniques. Finally, your bonus to Skill rolls while Sharingan is active increases to +2.</p> <h4 id="-dousatsugan---eye-of-insight-">–( Dousatsugan - Eye of Insight )–</h4> <p><em>Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan</em></p> <p>You can see the flow of chakra. This gives you a +4 bonus to defense rolls against genjutsu. More impressively, it allows you to copy any taijutsu technique you witness being performed, along with any ninjutsu or genjutsu which use handseals.</p> <p>This technique’s greatest limitation is its user. You must meet all skill requirements for the technique, and can’t copy elemental ninjutsu you don’t have the appropriate Elemental Aptitude for; Sealing and Medical techniques both require access to those types of jutsu in order for you to copy them.</p> <p>You automatically learn any valid techniques you see, and can use them for the remainder of the day. Additionally, you can keep two jutsu ‘copied’ indefinitely per stage of Sharingan you have unlocked, which you do not have to pay XP for. You can choose at any point to ‘forget’ one such jutsu in order to replace it with another jutsu, but can only do so when you see the jutsu copied: once you forget a jutsu, you must see it performed again to re-copy it with your Sharingan, and you can not simply fill the slots with Jutsu you could learn but have not seen copied just to avoid paying XP for them.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can choose at any point to learn a jutsu that you have copied by paying its normal XP cost. You may go into ‘XP debt’ to learn a jutsu this way, but can only have one jutsu learned via XP debt at a time, and all XP earned goes to paying off the XP debt before it can be spent on anything else.</p> <p>You may not copy custom or clan jutsu, as those are tailored too specifically to either the individual or the clan in question.</p> <h4 id="-saimingan---eye-of-hypnotism-">–( Saimingan - Eye of Hypnotism )–</h4> <p><em>Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan</em></p> <p>You may perform Genjutsu without handseals; however, this requires direct eye contact, meaning it can’t be used from hiding, must be targeting a person (rather than area), and can be avoided entirely if they simply shut their eyes (which brings its own penalties) or never look directly at your eyes (which can be done by just, say, staring at your, or their, feet, and affects them with a -4 Visibility Penalty).</p> <h4 id="-yogengan---eye-of-prediction-">–( Yogengan - Eye of Prediction )–</h4> <p><em>Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan</em></p> <p>Once per Fatigue level, you may declare use of this technique alongside a defensive interrupt requiring a roll. It allows you to “take 10” on any defensive roll; rather than rolling 1d20, you treat it as if your result had been a 10.</p> <p>You may also declare your action as ‘Observe’, a Variable Speed Action similar to blocking, in that for its duration, when attacked you may choose to activate Yogengan against any attack directed against you (and not have it count as your one use for that Fatigue level).</p> <p>Notably, this does not work with spending Willpower, which overrides (and does not combine with) this effect.</p> <h4 id="-shouningan---eye-of-recognition-">–( Shouningan - Eye of Recognition )–</h4> <p><em>Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan</em></p> <p>For starters, you can read lips. This is not some kind of ultra undetectable super-long-range spying technique; you have to actually have a clear view of the person’s lips, and it’s sorta conspicuous; though you can make an opposed Espionage roll to avoid them noticing, if you’re trying to hide the fact that you’re staring at their face.</p> <p>You can also copy a person’s handwriting just by seeing them write a single sentence. You can speed-read, and have a photographic memory. This has other uses, such as being able to tell how to pick a given lock by watching one person do it, or how to open a combination lock (though not necessarily the combination itself) by watching the movements of someone’s arms or hands as they do it.</p> <h4 id="-magen-kyouten-chiten---demonic-illusion-mirror-heaven-and-earth-change-">–( Magen: Kyouten Chiten - Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change )–</h4> <p>A form of illusion reversal, in which a Sharingan user simultaneously sees through and decrypts a Genjutsu technique, and then instantly reflects it upon its original user. Some Uchiha will go so far as to claim that this technique makes them immune to Genjutsu, and they’re… not too far from the truth.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Genjutsu</li> <li>Chakra: Special</li> <li>Speed: 6 + X</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may be used immediately after passing a Genjutsu Defense against a Genjutsu targeting you. You immediately perform that Genjutsu on its original user (paying its normal Chakra cost) via your Eye of Hypnotism, using your Genjutsu Defense roll as its new Accuracy. X is equal to speed of the Genjutsu you are performing. This can only be used on Genjutsu which you know (though copying them as they’re performed, and then reflecting them, is fair game).</p> <h4 id="-senchigan---eye-of-foresight-">–( Senchigan - Eye of Foresight )–</h4> <p><em>Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan</em></p> <p>It was once claimed, and rarely still is, that the Sharingan genuinely allows its wielder to see the future. What it actually does is pick up on minute changes in an opponent’s posture, minor eye movements, slight shifts of their weight, muscles tensing or relaxing in preparation for movement, even chakra building up in preparation for a jutsu.</p> <p>When you declare the use of this ability, declare a category of technique (such as Weapon Taijutsu, Katon, or Combo Taijutsu) and a Speed, and pick a single target. Your opponent then declares and rolls (if applicable) their defense. Any Interrupt may be used that’s valid against your declared Speed.</p> <p>After seeing this result, you may choose to use any technique of the declared type, with a combined (Seal Speed + Speed) equal to or lesser than your declared Speed. Its damage is based on its normal Speed, but its ability to be Interrupted, and when you take your next action, are based on the declared Speed. If your chosen technique would hit someone else (an ally within range of an AoE aimed at your original target, for example), then they can defend against it normally (after the original target has rolled, and after the Uchiha then declares their chosen attack). Any technique used this way has its Stamina or Chakra cost(s) increased by 4.</p> <p>If you choose to use a technique against which their reaction is invalid (such as performing Doton: Domu after they had rolled a 20 on their Suiton: Sujinheki), they do not have to pay the chakra costs or Speed of their Interrupt. On the other hand, using a technique that somehow bypasses their defense (such as Retsudotensho against Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu) is fair game.</p> <p>Techniques with a Delay can be used normally after declaring Foresight, but Foresight does not prevent or negate the Delay, meaning in all cases their defensive response would be invalid (because of the Delay itself), and Foresight would not benefit the action any further after the Delay is finished and the action resolves (though it would still incerease its Fatigue cost(s)). Techniques with a final Seal Speed greater than the rank of the jutsu used with it (E = 1, D = 2, etc) that you use Foresight with prevent you from using Principle of Motion (or effects which act like it, such as Tactician) to reduce when you next act, until your next non-interrupt action.</p> <h2 id="yamanaka-sun">Yamanaka (Sun)</h2> <p>With people working together to understand Ninshu, it was only a matter of time before the Yamanaka clan would be recognized as masters of the mind and soul. They are revered as seekers and messengers of truth, and were even contracted by other Kyosha for their interrogative abilities. As invaluable members of the Way of Sun and Moon, they represent the Light of Truth.</p> <h4 id="-sasayaki-kantoku-no-jutsu---whispering-oversight-technique-">–( Sasayaki Kantoku no Jutsu - Whispering Oversight Technique )–</h4> <p>A recent creation by the Yamanaka that has since become a staple of its Genin, this was developed because their secret techniques, despite their seemingly subtle nature, are quite overt and obvious to anyone under their effects. This technique allows the Yamanaka to see through the eyes of their target; as it lacks any visual cues, victims are typically left completely unaware it’s been used.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Genjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Range: 50</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Your consciousness hitches a ride in your target’s body, allowing you to experience everything the target does, as the target does with their own senses. This does not break Yamanaka Clan Telepathy, but you can not use it (or any other technique) while maintaining this technique. Your body is helpless while you maintain the Upkeep, but you are aware if it’s disturbed (shaken, stabbed, and so forth), though you can not actually hear if someone is talking to you next to your body until you return to it (by ending this technique).</p> <h4 id="-shindenshin-no-jutsu---mind-body-transmission-technique-">–( Shindenshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Transmission Technique )–</h4> <p>A subtle but invaluable technique of the Yamanaka that allows them to touch a person’s head and establish a telepathic link with them that they, and others the Yamanaka repeats the process on, can use to communicate. It has virtually limitless tactical applications, much to the ire of Chuunin Exam Proctors the world over.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Speed: 5</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This requires you to touch your target’s head; thereafter, they are part of your telepathic network. All people who you’ve brought in can talk to you, and one another, mentally. You can have up to CHA/20 people linked this way, not counting yourself.</p> <p>You can remove someone from this link, and they can remove themselves, at will. It has a maximum range of CHA*10 yards.</p> <p>If two Yamanaka link, their limits of people are combined, though each Yamanaka counts as one person towards the total limit. The distance limits are also pooled; as long as someone is within range of any of the linked Yamanaka, they can remain part of the network.</p> <h4 id="-shintenshin-no-jutsu---mind-body-switch-technique-">–( Shintenshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Switch Technique )–</h4> <p>The signature ability of the Yamanaka, this jutsu allows them to send their consciousness into a target’s body, seizing control of it and keeping their target, essentially, along for the ride. They’re aware of what’s going on, but unable to take any sort of action.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 6</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Range: 10 + CHA/5</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If you hit, the target suffers a Stun 20, and you gain control of the target’s body (but not any allies, or clones, of which they continue to control). Your own body is rendered comatose, prone (as per the E-Rank Taijutsu, Trip) and helpless, but you control your target’s actions.</p> <p>You may decide what non-interrupt actions they perform and what words they speak. They are still the ones performing the action, and use their attributes, abilities, et cetera. You may have them perform any jutsu you know, even if they lack the requirements to perform it, however elemental ninjutsu require the appropriate Aptitude to utilize (as you are using their abilities), and you use their Affinity instead of your own. You may only take actions with a final Stamina and/or Chakra Exhaustion cost of 15 + (your Chakra Control Ranks)/5 or less, including all links and modifiers. If an action requires an item or other physical component (such as a weapon) then they must have that item, not you. If an action has a cost other than a Chakra Cost, Stamina Cost, or physical object, then you pay that cost, not the target (i.e. willpower cost, fatigue levels, AP). Finally, you can not utilize the Eight Gates, Kage Bunshin, Summoning Contracts, or Natural Chakra while inside someone else’s body, to cause them to use any such talents; any of those talents you had open or were using before the possession, however, you can continue to use as normal. The target is otherwise still considered to be the one performing the action.</p> <p>When the victim’s life is threatened, survival instinct kicks in to override the Yamanaka’s control: Anytime someone you possess is attacked, the victim may decide their own interrupt response, although if they opt to not defend against an attack, you may declare a defense on their behalf. The victim can’t be made to take actions that bring themselves physical harm, such as jumping off a cliff, drinking poison, attacking oneself, or activating any of the eight gates. Because their psyches are connected, this is based on the Yamanaka’s knowledge as well as the victim’s. You suffer any damage, wounds, and fatigue level advancements the target suffers while possessing them.</p> <p>While possessed, the victim is aware of what their body is doing and is effectively a powerless bystander. They may communicate with the Yamanaka and engage in a battle of wills. Once per hour out of combat, the victim may make a Genjutsu Defense roll against the Yamanaka’s Genjutsu Offense. On a success, the Yamanaka is ejected from the body and wakes up in their own body 20 IC later (remaining helpless until that time). An additional test is made every time the Yamanaka would force them to physically harm an ally or loved one, when the target’s body suffers a Wound, and when they advance a fatigue level. Finally, the victim may spend a point of Willpower as a Speed 0 interrupt to make another Genjutsu Defense roll that, even if it fails, still cancels the action it interrupted (no costs are paid, and their IC does not advance), and inflicts a Stun 10 on both themselves and the Yamanaka.</p> <p>You gain a +5 bonus to your Genjutsu Offense rolls to maintain control of the target, but every time someone makes a Genjutsu Roll to try and escape from Shintenshin, Shinranshin, or Shinten Bunshin, they gain a cumulative +1 to all future Genjutsu Defense rolls to break free from any of those jutsu. The bonus does not go away until they’ve gone 24 hours without making such a roll.</p> <p>This technique may never be performed by clones, nor may it be used to possess a clone: Successfully hitting a clone with this technique immediately destroys it.</p> <p>You do not need to meet the normal skill or rank requirements for this technique. This technique’s normal Accuracy penalty is instead a bonus to Accuracy if your target is Stunned, or unable to move (such as by a -10 Immobilization penalty, or Kagemane). If you miss with it, however, you receive a Stun 20, though you are not helpless; you’re still in control of your body, just disoriented.</p> <h4 id="-shinranshin-no-jutsu---mind-body-disturbance-technique-">–( Shinranshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Disturbance Technique )–</h4> <p>A more powerful version of Shintenshin, this variant allows the Yamanaka to seize control of a victim’s body without abandoning their own. The control’s not complete, as a possessed person can still talk, shout a warning and so forth, but they can’t control their actions otherwise.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Chakra: 35</li> <li>Upkeep: 12</li> <li>Range: 25 + CHA/4</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You gain control of the victim’s body, controlling them as per Shintenshin (above). Unlike Mind Body Switch, your body does not become comatose and you do not receive any damage, wounds, or fatigue from this control. However, you have to spend AP equal to half the Speed of the action you force them to perform in combat (rounding up).</p> <p>In place of the normal once per hour Genjutsu Defense roll to break free, victims get a roll every 10 IC in combat, and once per minute outside of combat. The cumulative penalty to retain control of someone is shared between this technique, Mind Body Switch, and Mind Clone Switch.</p> <h4 id="-shinten-bunshin-no-jutsu---mind-clone-switch-technique-">–( Shinten Bunshin no Jutsu - Mind Clone Switch Technique )–</h4> <p>The final form of Shintenshin no Jutsu, this technique allows the Yamanaka to clone their own consciousness and transfer it into multiple targets at once, gaining complete control over all of them. Beyond the obvious tactical advantages, this allows for unprecedented coordination between the two bodies, as they share a single mind.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A</li> <li>Chakra: 40 + X * 5</li> <li>Upkeep: 4 + X * 2</li> <li>Range: 10 + CHA/4</li> <li>Speed: 20 + X * 5</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This functions as Mind Body Switch, except that you may target up to X people, and it does not have Shintenshin’s Accuracy penalty (though it can gain its normal Accuracy bonus). X has a maximum of CHA/40. So long as you successfully hit one person, you are rendered unconcious, as described in Shintenshin.</p> <p>Unlike Mind Body Switch, you do not take damage or fatigue levels immediately: Instead, when this jutsu ends (either because you ended the upkeep or all targets have broken free) you take the highest amount of damage all targets took while under the effect and gain Fatigue Levels equal to the highest number of Fatigue Levels gained by the targets while affected by this jutsu.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this jutsu does nothing to mitigate your sympathetic trauma. All wounds gained by each target are applied to your body immediately, just as with Shintenshin.</p> <p>The cumulative penalty to retain control of someone else is shared between Mind Body Switch, Mind Body Disturbance, and this technique.</p> <h2 id="yurigami-sun">Yurigami (Sun)</h2> <p>With the evolution of Fuuinjutsu came those who excelled in the manifestation of paper itself. These individuals were few, but regarded to the Way of Sun and Moon as messengers, great defenders, and guardian angels. With their few numbers, they didn’t want to be crushed by The Pride, so they were vassalized by the Uchiha, who then freed them to the Way of Sun and Moon, gladly taking them in.</p> <p><strong>Yurigami begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <h4 id="--paper-control--">-=[ Paper Control ]=-</h4> <p>The Yurigami can control paper in any form.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Cost: 0</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can control up to CHA/2 sheets of paper at once. You also have (CHA+RES)/3 sheets of ‘personal’ paper. For purposes of determining your limit, every two pieces of personal paper only count as one against it (thus, if you had 30 CHA, your limit is 15 sheets of paper for any given action; you could utilize 15 sheets of normal paper, or 10 sheets of normal paper plus 10 sheets of personal paper). Paper is considered perishable: that is, once used it is simply ‘gone’.</p> <h4 id="--paper--">-=[ Paper ]=-</h4> <p>Regular paper. This is useful for when the Yurigami has run out of personal paper, or does not want to use it.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Item</li> <li>Cost: 1 Ryo per sheet (Requisition)</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can be used in Yurigami techniques.</p> <h4 id="--rice-paper-creation--">-=[ Rice Paper Creation ]=-</h4> <p>As they progress in their abilities, the Yurigami develop the ability to turn their body into paper. What makes this so unusual is that it’s not a transformation technique, such as Henge; physically, they become paper, yet still function fully. Doing so, they’re able to shed portions of their body without appreciable harm, arming them with paper even when none is available.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 2</li> <li>Scale: 0</li> <li>Limiting Attribute: CHA/10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Each rank of this ability raises the Yurigami’s maximum Vitality by CHA/5. Each rank also allows 1 Vitality to be converted to one sheet of personal paper per IC as a Speed 0 Unfold action, which remains active until they choose to stop it (as another Speed 0 action, which is not an interrupt). They can not go over their normal maximum for personal paper in this way, and will stop losing Vitality (and gaining paper) once they reach their maximum, though will continue to make more unless it is stopped, as described above.</p> <h4 id="-origami-paper-assimilation-">–( Origami Paper Assimilation )–</h4> <p>As they are able to split portions of their body off into paper, the Yurigami can similarly reintegrate that same paper to themselves. Still, there is a difference between mere paper, and paper which is ‘them’; regrettably, being in a library does not make them near-immortal.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 5</li> <li>Scale: 0</li> <li>Limiting Attribute: CHA/20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can take a Speed 5 Recall action to recall up to CHA/2 sheets of paper that you have used in this battle, per rank of this ability. This applies only to your personal paper.</p> <p>Additionally, you may take a special Speed 5 Refold action to repair your body with personal paper, at the rate of 1 Vitality per sheet of paper, to a maximum of 5 Vitality per rank.</p> <p>You may combine these two effects into a single Speed 10 action (in order to recall paper, and refold paper, at the same time).</p> <h4 id="-paper-wall-">–( Paper Wall )–</h4> <p>The Yurigami strengthens several pieces of paper, using them as a physical barrier against attacks. This can be done any number of ways, from a levitating cloud of defensive papers, to parrying a blade with a stack held in one hand, to hardening and then flaking off the paper making up the Yurigami’s body.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Cost: X sheets of paper</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You utilize sheets of paper to defend yourself by making them as rigid and resilient as thin sheets of metal. Every piece of paper spent this way stops 2 points of damage. Personal paper used this way stops 3 points of damage per sheet; however, paper used this way cannot be recalled through Origami Paper Assimilation, having been destroyed in the process. This may also be used after a failed defense as a +0 Speed action, succeeding automatically but destroying 1 sheet of paper per point of damage; used this way, it can only be performed with personal paper. For attacks which have effects based on how much you are hit, Paper Wall is treated the same as Block would be.</p> <h4 id="-paper-shuriken-">–( Paper Shuriken )–</h4> <p>Sheets of paper are folded into shuriken-like shapes, or sharpened to razor edges, and launched at an enemy.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Cost: X * 5 sheets of paper</li> <li>Damage: Xd8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Speed: 3+X/2</li> </ul> <p>Effects: X is the number of shuriken thrown. This jutsu functions as a multi-throw, following its normal rules (minimum 5 speed, etc), does not have any Stamina cost, you use CHA in place of DEX to determine how many weapons you can throw, and in place of STR to determine your Range with the shuriken (making it ordinarily 5+CHA/4), and you use your NDB in place of PDB.</p> <p>This can be modified, or used in conjunction, with anything that applies to shuriken or thrown weapons (uniques, abilities, jutsu, etc), but anything that increases the number of weapons you throw increases the number of sheets of paper you must use accordingly (while you are still limited by the amount of paper you can utilize at once) and anything that would ordinarily destroy them in the process (such as the Katon Meteor Shower) also destroys the sheets of paper used in this technique.</p> <p>Effects which increase the amount of weapons thrown (such as Quick Hands) have no cost; Effects which add a new cost (such as Meteor Shower) function as normal.</p> <p>This is complicated slightly when adding multiple effects and/or links to this jutsu in an Action Chain: Effects which ordinarily increase a cost applicable to this jutsu (such as Weapon Focus, or Homing) will instead add an equivalent amount of sheets of paper, unless a base fatigue cost of the same type is added by a link (such as Meteor Shower), in which case fatigue costs of the same type add together to determine the total (as is normal for links). For example, if you threw 4 shuriken and used Homing 2 with it, your cost is simply (4 * 5 + 3 * 2) = 26 sheets of paper; if you linked Meteor Shower with Paper Shuriken and Homing 2, throwing 4 shuriken again, the cost would become (8 + 4/2 = 10, + 3*2 = 16 CE, plus (4 * 5) = 20 sheets of paper to perform.</p> <p>Note that effects which state things like “the weapons used in this technique are ruined or destroyed” includes the paper utilized in this jutsu, which can not be recovered and is considered destroyed.</p> <h4 id="-parchment-weapon-formation-">–( Parchment Weapon Formation )–</h4> <p>A relatively advanced technique, this allows the creation of durable, physical weapons from paper, by bending, folded, hardening, and sharpening sheets appropriately. Virtually anything can be made, limited only by the Yurigami’s ability to control the requisite amount of paper.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Cost: X sheets of paper</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You may create any weapon from the equipment section of PHB, mimicking its stats, using X sheets of paper; every die of damage the weapon does costs 3 sheets of paper, and melee weapons have their cost doubled. Arrows can be created also with this technique (multiple at once of multiple types, even!), for 5 paper each, but can not be further modified by spending additional paper on them (such modifications are done to the Bow used to fire them). If you cannot match a weapon’s damage dice, you cannot create it. A weapon thrown or discarded has its paper expended, and weapons created this way cannot be given to someone else to use. Any Personal Paper used in a weapon’s creation cannot be reclaimed without destroying the weapon in the process, but after its creation, the weapon’s paper sheets do not count against the limit of Paper Control. Beyond the minimum to create the weapon, you may spend additional paper to improve the weapon:</p> <blockquote> <p>+1 Damage Die: 4 sheets (Maximum double normal dice) +1 Accuracy: 10 sheets of paper (Maximum 2) Ignore 1 point of DR: 1 sheet</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="-paper-clone-">–( Paper Clone )–</h4> <p>Using the Yurigami’s control of paper, they modify the shape and color of their paper in order to create physical duplicates of themselves.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Cost: 20+ sheets of paper per clone</li> <li>Speed: 10 + 3 per clone</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create one or more clones made from your personal paper, to a maximum of 3. By default, you are considered hidden among your clones when you create them, following the normal rules for clones. You may direct them to take actions by spending AP.</p> <p>These clones may use basic attacks, dodge, parry, move, and use Parchment Weapon Formation and Paper Shuriken, costing 1 AP per 3 speed of the action they perform, and automatically reclaim all used paper. Unlike normal clones they can actually take damage, and have Vitality equal to five times the amount of paper used in their creation, though if they take damage equal to or greater than their Vitality they are destroyed, collapsing into however much paper was used to create them, minus 20 sheets, which are destroyed.</p> <p>When Paper Clones attack, they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category. Paper clones use your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses as if they were a Fatigue 1 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier pill, or any upkeeps or wounds or status effects affecting you), and if they fail a Fatigue roll, they collapse as if they’d been destroyed by damage.</p> <p>Paper clones have your mind, and can act independently. You are aware of their location, and they yours, though your senses are not linked. You may reabsorb a Paper clone by touching it, in which case you ‘download’ all its memories.</p> <h4 id="-dance-of-the-shikigami-">–( Dance of the Shikigami )–</h4> <p>The pinnacle of development of the Yurigami’s abilities, with this ability not only can they turn themselves completely into paper, they no longer need to maintain their body’s physical cohesion; they are every bit as self-aware as a cloud of flying sheets of paper as in a true ‘human’ form. Whether or not a Yurigami capable of performing this technique can even be considered fully human any more is up for debate.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Cost: 1 Willpower</li> <li>Upkeep: 0</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The user turns their body into paper. This removes all per-IC limitations of Rice Paper Creation and Origami Paper Assimilation while active, and turns the latter into a non-action that can be done at any time. You may shed and replace damaged sheets of paper, more unfolding from within you in the wake of wounds, granting you CHA/5 DR. In this form you are immune to Bleed, Burns, and Poison, and as well as all effects which add to damage for the purpose of wounding (such as several Fuuton jutsu, Anatomical Knowledge, etc). Finally, while using Dance of the Shikigami, doujutsu cannot automatically distinguish you from your clones.</p> <h4 id="--origami-body--">-=[ Origami Body ]=-</h4> <p>The Yurigami breaks apart, dissolving their physical form entirely into an amorphous cloud of paper sheets.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Cost: 100</li> <li>Requires: Dance of the Shikigami</li> </ul> <p>Effects: As a separate Speed 10 action after activating Dance of the Shikigami, this ability allows you to fully dissolve into paper. In this form you automatically block attacks (even after a failed defense) and have a +3 bonus to Dodge. You cannot be directly targeted by Genjutsu (though area Genjutsu will affect you normally). However, in this form you cannot perform any non-Yurigami jutsu other than Genjutsu Kai and the Grapple Taijutsu Grab, Throw, any of the ‘locks’ (arm, leg, head) and Chokehold, using your NDB in place of your PDB for any grapple rolls, with a +5 bonus. You may elect to end a grapple as a Speed 2 Interrupt as the defender. An enemy grappled by you may not shift a grapple against you, only break free.</p> <p>You have a -5 penalty when attempting to dodge area-of-effect jutsu, do not have the option to block them automatically, and take +50% damage from them.</p> <p>You may use Folding Cyclone Blades, a variant of Paper Shuriken with up to double your normal limit on paper sheets, which does not use up any of the sheets used in it.</p> <p>You can use this form to fly, travel through tight spaces, and so forth. When flying, your movement speed is halved, though you may not be hit by melee attacks unless they can move a number of yards as part of the attack equal to your elevation (by jumping!), and the maximum height you can reach in combat is limited by your ranks in Chakra Control.</p> <p>You may shift out of this form as another Speed 10 action.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
