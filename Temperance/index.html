They combined their efforts and worked together to instill this power into their bloodlines and it gave them power over the very environment itself. They could make land in an instant, and bring peace or ruin where they felt it was just.</p> <h2 id="hozuki-primal-sea">Hozuki (Primal Sea)</h2> <p>The monks of the Temperance reached out to the Hozuki clan for their ability to turn into water. While this was not an inherent connection to nature but more of a Ninshu ability to transform, it was refined under the training of the monks, someone that the clan would not want to pass up. A rare chance to test their abilities against other elemental masters.</p> <p><strong>Hozuki begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <p>Hozuki begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Water.</p> <h4 id="-suika-no-jutsu---hydration-technique-">–( Suika no Jutsu - Hydration Technique )–</h4> <p>The Hozuki clan’s pride is the ability to liquify their entire body, from bones to organs to hair, turning into living water. Although they normally maintain a humanoid form, there is nothing preventing them from turning into a puddle and slipping under a door or escaping down a drain–though they lose their ability to perceive their surroundings if they don’t keep at least their head in tact.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Speed: Special</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Liquifying is a Speed 5 Interrupt (which does not require a roll to succeed), while solidifying is a Speed 0 action. While in water form, the following effects are applied:</p> <ul> <li>You take only 25% damage from Suiton, and 50% from Katon.</li> <li>You cannot block Doton or Raiton.</li> <li>You take +50% damage from Raiton, and any non-environmental Shock status effects they apply also inflict you with a Stun of twice their severity.</li> <li>You are immune to all non-Energy-wound dealing Taijutsu, and medical ninjutsu (except for Ranshinshou).</li> <li>Nintaijutsu deal damage based on their respective element.</li> <li>You are immune to, and do not suffer the penalties of existing, Wounds.</li> <li>You can breathe underwater.</li> <li>Your Physical Damage Bonus is set to 0.</li> <li>You cannot grapple or be grappled, and ignore non-Internal Immobility Penalties and effects which work by restraining or caging you.</li> <li>You always have an additional 10+(Chakra Control ranks/2) gallons of water to use with Suiton techniques, which nobody else may access. If you figure out why, you get a cookie. This water is never used up, or considered to be added to the battlefield, and can not be utilized for techniques with an Upkeep, for clones, or sealed via Fuinjutsu (such as confinement seal scroll, or element sealing method).</li> <li>You cannot be burnt, poisoned, or ignited, and ignore the effects of those statuses while in liquid form; their durations still decrease normally (and Ignite automatically ends).</li> <li>You cannot open any Gates, do not gain any bonuses from having any Gates open and while liquified, you can’t generate or spend Gate-specific AP, nor do you suffer the normal Wounding chance. You regain all benefits of Gates once you solidify and do not have to re-open any Gates opened before liquifying, however.</li> </ul> <p>You may not liquify (though you can still solidify) if you are suffering from a Paralysis effect which was caused by a Raiton technique. If incapacitated while liquified you revert to a semi-solid, translucent gel-like form. In this state you do not heal at all unless immersed in water, at which point you begin recovering normally.</p> <h4 id="-masakana-namiochiru---demon-fish-wave-crash-">–( Masakana Namiochiru - Demon Fish Wave Crash )–</h4> <p>Pulling in water from all around you and extending your chakra from your watery form into it all, you turn into a mass of animate water which a vague outline of yourself at the center. Despite the jutsu’s name, the water constantly tends to change shape and features, but most who see it can swear they see something demonic formed. This not only offers protection to the user, but also allows them to come crashing down upon their enemies as well.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 25</li> <li>Upkeep: 8</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: Suika no Jutsu active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You no longer take extra damage from Raiton, and are not stunned by it. Your Physical Damage Bonus is no longer reduced to zero, though you can not utilize any Taijutsu except for Basic Unarmed Attacks and Crashing Tsunami, below. When you first activate this technique you can absorb up to CHA/5 gallons of water from the battlefield into yourself, gaining +Gallons/10 to your PDB and +Gallons/2 in Damage Reduction (both of which do not count Suika’s inherent gallons, as you can not absorb yourself, Xavis). You can hold, and benefit from, an extra CHA/2 gallons of water this way.</p> <p>The water which you absorb into yourself can not be used by anyone else to fuel Suiton techniques, but can be converted or destroyed (via Boiling or Water Sky Convergence, for example), though this does not apply to Suika’s inherent gallons of water.</p> <h6 id="-crashing-tsunami-">–( Crashing Tsunami )–</h6> <p>Less of a technique and more of just a watery slam of a Hozuki’s body when enlarged and engorged by Masakana Namiochiru, it is nonetheless effective at using the full weight of the water gathered to overwhelm opponents.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Suiton Taijutsu</li> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: (CHA/10)d12</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You may move up to CHA/5 additional yards when you use this attack (in addition to the normal movement when attacking), and you may collect up to CHA/5 additional gallons of water into yourself during this movement, assuming they are present on the battlefield. This technique uses your Physical Damage Bonus and deals Blunt wounds.</p> <h4 id="-gosuiwan-no-jutsu---great-water-arm-technique-">–( Gosuiwan no Jutsu - Great Water Arm Technique )–</h4> <p>Putting their hydration into practical, but less-extreme use, a Hozuki can force moisture into a single limb (typically an arm) and give themselves what amounts to hydraulic muscles. The difficulty of this technique comes from how essential it is to properly control the distribution of water throughout the body, but when used properly, this gives superhuman strength.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Chakra: 20 + X*2</li> <li>Upkeep: X/2</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This increases your Physical Damage Bonus by X, to a maximum of CHA/30. This bonus is doubled against inanimate objects, up to and including ninjutsu-made walls, such as Earth Shore Return, though it never is doubled against people. This technique’s effects are suppressed whenever you liquify via the Hydration technique, and this cannot be used while Suika no Jutsu is active.</p> <h2 id="hitori-summer">Hitori (Summer)</h2> <p>Originally, the Hitori and the Temperance were enemies. They were so powerful, that they felt they did not require a Kyosha. However, as the chakra suppressing power of the Way of Sun and Moon threatened them, they needed to find people who would protect them, and fast. Unfortunately, they burned most of their bridges, and were reluctant to ally with the Temperance, but after being shown their kindness and generosity, accepted their friendship.</p> <p><strong>Hitori begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <p>Hitori begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Wind ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes Katon and Fuuton.</p> <h4 id="--shakuton---scorch-release--">-=[ Shakuton - Scorch Release ]=-</h4> <p>Combining Fire and Wind chakra results in the advanced nature of ‘Scorch Release’; as the name suggests, it involves using extreme heat as a weapon, with powerful users being able to reduce opponents to ash or evaporate the liquid inside their body, sapping away their strength.</p> <p>Any Katon or Fuuton technique can be converted to Shakuton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes:</p> <ul> <li>Deal 75% normal damage, but can not be blocked</li> <li>They gain +CHA/30 to their Accuracy</li> <li>Inflict a Dehydration status of severity (1 per Rank of the jutsu) + CHA / (90 - 10*Rank). In other words, for an E-Rank this is 1+CHA/80, for a D-Rank it is 2+CHA/70, and so on, up to 5+CHA/40 for A-rank techniques</li> <li>Shakuton can increase a victim’s Dehydration status up to a maximum of 3+(CHA/8)</li> <li>Shakuton can not inflict Burns or Ignite</li> <li>Fuuton converted to Shakuton may not be used with a Fan.</li> <li>Any Ignite a technique would normally inflict instead adds +5% to Wounding per severity of Ignite</li> <li>Any jutsu converted with an inherent bonus to Wounding instead applies a Stun of (Wounding Bonus%)/20, rounded down</li> <li>Shakuton techniques can not be reduced below Speed 5, after all other modifications</li> </ul> <p>Shakuton is weak to Suiton, and strong against Fuuton and Doton</p> <h6 id="-dehydration-">–( Dehydration )–</h6> <p>This is a Status Effect, applied on hit. Every point of Dehydration applies a -1 penalty to the victim’s Stamina rolls, and lowers the victim’s Physical Damage Bonus by 0.3. Dehydrate stacks fully with itself; Dehydration 3 added to Dehydration 2 makes a single Dehydrate 5 status, which applies a -5 to Stamina, and a -1.5 to their PDB. Dehydrate from the same source (person) stacks fully with itself; if you suffer Dehydrate from different people, only the highest severity applies.</p> <p>There is one exception: Dehydrate’s Stamina penalty does not stack with Burns, and if you happen to be suffering from both status effects, you take the higher of the two, rather than both, to Stamina rolls: If you were suffering from Dehydration 2, and received a Burns 3, your Stamina penalty would be -3, and your PDB penalty would be -0.6. If you then cleared your Burns status, the Stamina penalty would lower to -2.</p> <p>Any effects which reduce Stamina penalties reduce the severity of your Dehydration by the same amount. However, unlike Burns, Dehydrate is not cleared when failing a fatigue roll, and instead it is only reduced by half (rounding up) of its original value.</p> <p>Outside of battle, this status effect goes away at a rate of one per minute.</p> <h4 id="-kasou-no-jutsu---cremation-technique-">–( Kasou no Jutsu - Cremation Technique )–</h4> <p>You focus your chakra on a victim, and simply light them ablaze.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank C</li> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Range: CHA/2</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Special: X Ignite + Special</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique ignores the normal rule that Shakuton can not inflict Ignite; X is the victim’s Dehydration status (and thus, if you use it on someone without it, this technique has no effect), and does enjoy Shakuton’s typical +CHA/40 Accuracy. Your target’s Dehydrate status is removed (after applying the Ignite) if they pass a status roll; if they fail, then their Dehydrate status is instead only lowered by half, rounding up.</p> <p>In addition to the Ignite, your target suffers a penalty to their Resistance equal to X, which doesn’t go away until the Ignite itself does.</p> <h4 id="--sabaku-no-keshin---incarnation-of-desert-">– ( Sabaku no Keshin - Incarnation of Desert )–</h4> <p>You project your chakra out across the battlefield, with devastating results. The temperature rises, plants begin to wilt and wither, and hopefully nothing nearby is particularly combustible.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank B</li> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Upkeep: 6</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Area: Ninjutsu Damage Bonus * 2</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Everyone within the range except you has their Dehydrate status increased by 1+(CHA/50) when you activate this technique, and every 10 IC afterward, so long as you maintain its Upkeep. Anyone within the area (which moves with you) with a Dehydration status (again, except you) takes a penalty to their Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to their Dehydrate status, and has their Ninjutsu Damage Bonus lowered by 0.3 per point of Dehydration they have; this penalty remains until they leave the area (or remove their Dehydration status).</p> <h2 id="monkasei-primal-earth-noble">Monkasei (Primal Earth, Noble)</h2> <p>The Monkasei and the Senju are shapers of Earth. They were one of the original founders of the Temperance and built all of their temples within the Mountaintops. Dedicated to making the world a better place, they often make battlefields a living nightmare to fight in. Once the Hitori joined the Temperance, it was not long before the war needed to stop because their combination left crippling losses to all sides but their own. [This clan is Noble]</p> <p><strong>Monkasei begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <p>Monkasei begin with Elemental Aptitude for Doton and Fuuton ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Jiton, which includes Doton and Fuuton.</p> <h4 id="--jiton---magnetism-release--">-=[ Jiton - Magnetism Release ]=-</h4> <p>Though commonly referred to as ‘magnetic’ Chakra, in actuality it is a little more nuanced: Jiton can react with even non-ferrous metals, and Monkasei are never so obvious as to carry around dozens of pounds of iron to make use of their Kekkei Genkai. Rather, they tend to exert control over another substance–almost always Sand, though that might just be a matter of convenience, as it’s light-weight and there’s an infinite supply in their homeland–which is infused with a metal in some form or fashion to thereby control it. Previous Kazekages were known for their Iron Sand and Gold Dust usage, but every Monkasei has their own preferences as to how they utilize their talent, and it’s not known whether the choice is simply a matter of preference, or if different Monkasei can control different metals better than others.</p> <p>Note that while you are manipulating <em>some</em> amount of metal, Jiton-converted techniques are ‘Sand’ techniques, not ‘Metal’: a Jiton Tremorsense would let you do so on Sand, not on Metal. Likewise, Jiton Earth Shaping would let you shape magnificent sand castles, not manipulate metal walls or objects.</p> <p>Any Fuuton or Doton technique can be converted to Jiton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes:</p> <ul> <li>Blocking reduces the damage of Jiton techniques by 25% less.</li> <li>Non-Upkeep Jiton which are Environmental, or Ground-based, create a number of Gallons of Sand equal to twice their rank: 2 for E, 4 for D, etc.</li> <li>All other Jiton techniques have a Sand cost, in Gallons, according to the Rank of the jutsu: 2 for E, 4 for D, 8 for C, 16 for B, 32 for A. Jiton with Upkeeps require an amount equal to their Upkeep, or the amount listed for their Rank, whichever is higher.</li> <li>Interrupt Jiton do not create Sand; those of Rank D or below remove all Gallons of Sand used with them from the battlefield, while those of Rank C or higher remove only half the Gallons of Sand used with them.</li> <li>Non-Interrupt Fuuton converted to Jiton have their base Speed increased by 1 per Rank (E = +1, D = +2, etc, up to A = +5).</li> <li>Jiton with Upkeeps grant the Monkasei an amount of Charge equivalent to the Upkeep the Monkasei suffers from while maintaining them; Upkeeps from other sources (such as Chakra Strengthening) do not grant the Monkasei any Charge.</li> <li>Fuuton converted to Jiton may not be used with a fan.</li> <li>If a Jiton has its Seal Speed reduced to 0, then you need not make any handseals for it at all.</li> <li>Jiton is strong against Doton and Raiton, but weak against Fuuton.</li> </ul> <h6 id="-charge-">–( Charge )–</h6> <p>This is a status effect, applied to the Monkasei, representing their control over their element–in this case, metal-infused Sand–and the ease of which they can utilize it the more their chakra is infused into it. While exhausting to maintain control over so much material, Monkasei have learned to turn a weakness into a strength, in the following ways.</p> <p>All values of X are based on your current Charge status:</p> <ul> <li>+X/2 to Chakra Exhaustion rolls for Jiton techniques</li> <li>X/4 reduction to the base Speed of all Jiton Interrupt techniques, to a minimum of base Speed 4, ignoring normal limits.</li> <li>-X/2 Seal Speed</li> <li>-X/2 Delay (if it has any, to a minimum of 0).</li> <li>Damage dealing Jiton have their dice that roll below X/4 rerolled once, up to a maximum of (die size/4).</li> </ul> <p>The last benefit can be confusing! So, for example, as long as your Charge was 4 or more, your Jiton Wind Cutter would have all of its damage dice rerolled once if they came up as a 1. This can be done automatically if using the Dice Golem bot by adding ‘ro1’ to the damage dice calculation, meaning Wind Cutter would be typed as the following: (2d4ro1 * 5 + NDB * Speed). Higher Charge levels than 4 would never increase Wind Cutter’s ability to reroll its dice above 1, because it is capped at (die size/4), rounding down, thus, 4/4 = 1.</p> <h4 id="-purification-">–( Purification )–</h4> <p>So long as a Monkasei has access to some sort of solid ground (i.e., is not floating in the middle of the ocean), and has a few handfuls of their choice of metal shavings, a Monkasei can apply pressure to rock, soil, wood, or similar surfaces and materials to, essentially, pulverize them into miniscule splinters and shavings to be made use of. Most Monkasei prefer to carry around materials already infused with their choice of metal to avoid this process (and to avoid showing its usage off to anyone), but in times of need, Monkasei can gather up more material to make use of their kekkai genkai. If you ever have to ask whether you can bore through a material with this jutsu, assume the answer is ‘No’.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank E</li> <li>Chakra: +5</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> <li>Seal Speed: +X</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link with any Jiton technique which creates Sand; the technique creates triple the normal amount. X is based off of the Rank of the Jutsu (E=1, D=2, etc). Thus, an E-rank Jiton would create six gallons of sand, instead of two, at Chakra +5, Speed +1, Seal Speed +1; a D-rank Jiton would create twelve gallons at Chakra +5, Speed +2, Seal Speed +2, etc.</p> <p>Keep in mind that ‘Sand’ is more like ‘weathered and eroded bits of dirt and stone’, but it works for a Monkasei’s purposes.</p> <h4 id="-sabaku-kyu---sand-coffin-">–( Sabaku Kyu - Sand Coffin )–</h4> <p>No one likes Sand. It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere. Which the Monkasei tend to use to their advantage in order to slow down and debilitate their opponents through tactical, frustrating maneuvering that makes everything chafe.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank D</li> <li>Chakra: +(2+X/4)</li> <li>Speed: +Y</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can be added onto any damage-dealing Jiton Ninjutsu; X is the Gallons of Sand utilized in the Jutsu, while Y is the Rank of the Jutsu it is used with. In addition to the attack’s normal damage and effects, anyone hit by the technique also takes a (1 + Y) Immobility Penalty, though in doing so you ‘use up’ the gallons of sand the jutsu required which stick to, and slow down, the movement of those affected.</p> <p>Against someone already suffering from an Immobility Penalty caused by Sand Coffin you stack the Immobility Penalty as a single status (unlike normal), but the amount is reduced to Y, rather than (1+Y). Thus if you used a Jiton Earthworm Sabaku Kyu, it would initially apply a -2 Immobility Penalty; if hit again while still suffering from Sabaku Kyu’s Immobility Penalty, repeated applications would only increase the Immobility Penalty by 1.</p> <p>Once the Sand is no longer applying a penalty to someone, it is added back to the battlefield for use.</p> <p>If used with a Jutsu which already applies an Immobility Penalty (such as a Jiton-converted Clay Bullet), you need not pay its normal Chakra or Speed cost.
