**Naruto World** is a homebrew game system taking elements from several other systems (Exalted, d20, etc) to create a unique play experience for a game set in the world of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto), a shonen manga created by Masashi Kishimoto. This is a non-commercial project done out of love for the series and setting, and a collaborative effort from dozens of people over just as many years in order to refine and improve a set of rules ultimately meant to bring enjoyment to all that struggle through the many, many intricacies in order to play pretend ninjas with others.

On behalf of everyone who's worked on the PHB, we hope you'll join us to create more engaging stories.

On this page you'll also find link to the most recent updates, click them to see a full list of changes as they're published. You should expect any updates to the PHB to be released on Friday evenings.

While this game has been a collaborative effort from dozens of people throughout the years, I want to first and foremost thank the late, great Emily, without whom this game would not exist, though there is a more exhaustive list of contributors that have worked on the game throughout the years that you can find [HERE](https://nwwayward.github.io/Credits/).
