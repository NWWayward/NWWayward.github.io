This is a fantastic technique for smuggling items or transporting them in secrecy, its utility counteracted only by its vulnerabilities.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This completely hides an object from casual observation. Against a detailed search, it gives a +5 bonus to any rolls to keep it hidden, and allows the obect to, essentially, hide in plain sight. You have to keep contact with the object, or at least keep it close to you (say, in a belt holster). It won’t hide it if you’re being patted down. If the object interacts with the rest of the world (such as taking a swing with a weapon, or using a key to open a door) the concealment ends.</p> <h4 id="-genkoe---hallucinatory-voices-">–( Genkoe - Hallucinatory Voices )–</h4> <p>Despite its name, this technique isn’t limited to voices, or even auditory hallucinations. It has no effect at all until the victim begins paying a bit too much attention to their surroundings, at which point the technique begins playing tricks on their senses, causing them to see movement at the corner of their vision and gentle sounds just slightly too vague to place.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 7</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique inflicts a -2 penalty to Awareness rolls. It also halves the bonus for consecutive actions spent searching (so if you Searched three consecutive times with Genkoe applied to you, you’d have a +3, rather than +6, bonus on your next roll)</p> <h4 id="-mousou-enmu-no-jutsu---illusory-mist-technique-">–( Mousou Enmu no Jutsu - Illusory Mist Technique )–</h4> <p>Masquerading as a higher-ranked Suiton technique, this creates a light bank of fog which has little effect beyond making the atmosphere a bit chillier. An illusion is then laid on all those present, tricking them into believing the mist is actually thick enough to be a hindrance.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 3</li> <li>Area: 25</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 7</li> <li>Tags: Targeted Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Anyone within the area when it is first used defends against this technique (the user may exclude allies if they wish), and on a failure takes a -4 Visibility Penalty. More insidiously, so long as they remain within the mist they have a -2 penalty to all their defensive genjutsu rolls. People who pass their genjutsu roll still see the mist, but for what it really is: too thin and wispy to actually be an impediment, taking none of the effects. The mist cloud moves with its user.</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-kasumi-juusha-no-jutsu---mist-servant-technique-">–( Kasumi Juusha no Jutsu - Mist Servant Technique )–</h4> <p>This jutsu creates clones that phase in and out of the ground as if they were made of a blackish, oil-like liquid. When attacked, the clones regenerate themselves. The clones can be controlled to make it seem as if they’re attacking. The user can then time their attacks with those of the clones to remain concealed.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Tags: Clone, Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This genjutsu creates dozens of illusions of the user. Anyone in combat with them must ‘defend’ against this technique with a genjutsu roll; against anyone who fails, you are considered to be in level 1 Stealth as one of the clones, making a Stealth roll to determine your Stealth TN.</p> <p>The clones are harmless, and slow-moving, but may feign attacks intermittently. You may attack from stealth normally, but in addition to ranged attacks, you may make any basic weapon or unarmed attack without breaking stealth. Each attack lowers your Stealth TN by 3, rather than 5. If you take a Hide or Improve Hiding action, this technique’s benefits end. Once you’ve been found, you cannot hide among these clones again; you’d need to use the technique once more to do that.</p> <h4 id="-oboro-bunshin-no-jutsu---haze-clone-technique-">–( Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu - Haze Clone Technique )–</h4> <p>This creates what appear to be ordinary bunshin, even responding and vanishing when struck. However, each time one clone is destroyed another takes its place, typically just out of sight of whoever destroyed its predecessor.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Upkeep: 0</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Tags: Clone, Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create three clones of yourself. These function as normal clones, but you are always ‘hidden’ among your clones (as per the ‘Hide Among Clones’ action), even after you’ve been hit by an opponent.</p> <p>Taking an Observe action allows an opponent to make a genjutsu roll to realize that this is an illusion (and subsequently may attempt to dispel the illusion with Kai as per an area genjutsu once they successfully realize it), but cannot actually single you out from your clones. Any time an attack destroys your clones (whether it’s one or all three), another one appears to take its place and the Upkeep is increased by 1.</p> <p>If this technique is ended and reapplied within the same battle, it retains the Upkeep it had at the time its previous use ended. No initial genjutsu roll is made; opponents are, by default, tricked into believing these are normal clones. However, after the first time they realize this technique for what it is (i.e. an illusion) in battle, they’ll also recognize all future uses of it in that same battle as such.</p> <h4 id="-magen-narakumi-no-jutsu---demonic-illusion-hell-viewing-technique-">–( Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique )–</h4> <p>The user creates an illusion of spinning leaves around the victim, after the leaves disappear, the illusion begins, showing the victim something they’d rather never see, be it a loved one hurt, a monster of their nightmares, or some other such thing. In most cases, it is easy to identify that the image is fake, due to the unlikeliness of it occurring, but some images still leave a foul sensation in ones mind.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Stun 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Whatever image this subjects the victim to, the end result is they lose a point of Willpower. After the first time in a day this is (successfully) used on someone, the ‘horror’ begins to lose impact, reducing its effects to Stun 10 and no Willpower loss. If this genjutsu is broken (by the target being wounded, or somebody else using Kai on them) the Stun will end prematurely, but the lost Willpower will not be regained. If used on a target with 0 Willpower remaining, this technique’s Stun is doubled (to 40, or 20, depending on whether or not it’s been used on them previously in that battle).</p> <h4 id="-magen-jigoku-kouka-no-jutsu---demonic-illusion-descending-hell-technique-">–( Magen: Jigoku Kouka no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell Technique )–</h4> <p>This illusion causes any afflicted by it to see a massive fireball forming above them which slowly descends. Most prudent shinobi will waste time trying to escape its radius, while those who are more reckless will take the ‘attack’ head-on, bracing themselves against a blow that never actually comes.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Area: 25</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The target of this genjutsu has 25 IC to move 25 yards away from the location they begin at when affected by this genjutsu (i.e., an Area 25 centerd on themselves); if they don’t, they suffer a Stun 15. Ending this genjutsu before the timer of 25 IC has passed causes them to avoid the Stun, but once Stunned, the genjutsu itself has ended and they can not be cleared of the Stun by any means which would remove the genjutsu.</p> <p>Using the Multi-Targeting ability with this genjutsu applies the Area of the ‘fireball’ to each victim individually (based on their own positions), but each target need only move out of the area of their <em>own</em> fireball.</p> <h4 id="-shinkirou-no-jutsu---mirage-technique-">–( Shinkirou no Jutsu - Mirage Technique )–</h4> <p>This creates an illusion that can fool a person’s sight, hearing, or smell–or, with more effort, two of those, or all three. These can be dynamic (such as a flickering fire or a fluttering curtain), but they can’t actually interact with anything.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 3</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Area: 2 (max)</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: By default, this creates an illusion that only applies to one sense; examples would be an illusion of a curtain flapping in a breeze, or the sound of footsteps. By raising the chakra cost by 5, the illusion can apply to two senses, such as a tiger that crouches and snarls. Raising the chakra cost by 10 (to a total of 20) allows the illusion to be convincing to all three, such as a fire that flickers, crackles, and smells like burning wood. This technique’s primary limitation is its scale. It can’t do anything much larger than a large piece of furniture or more complicated than one person. Anyone who interacts with this illusion is allowed a Genjutsu roll to realize it’s a fake, though some things can make this obviously fake, such as touching it or standing at the ‘source’ of the noise and realizing there’s nothing there. You can control this illusion if you’re in range; if not, you can set it to be essentially a looping recording.</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-kyousanken-no-jutsu---iron-curtain-technique-">–( Kyousanken no Jutsu - Iron Curtain Technique )–</h4> <p>The user places themself under a harmless genjutsu, which itself serves no purpose but makes it more difficult for other genjutsu to affect you normally.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: So long as this technique’s upkeep is maintained, you have a +4 bonus to defensive genjutsu rolls. This genjutsu does not end when you’re wounded. You may declare Iron Curtain as an Interrupt when targeted with genjutsu, following the normal rules for defensive interrupts and giving you its bonus for that defensive genjutsu roll. Iron Curtain does remain active (as if activated normally) after being used this way.</p> <h4 id="-kori-shinchuu-no-jutsu---sly-mind-affect-technique-">–( Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu - Sly Mind Affect Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique warps an opponent’s senses and sets them walking in circles, potentially for hours on end, by making it seem to them as if they’re walking straight towards their desired destination. Maps, compasses, and paths will all be ineffective–the best someone suffering from this technique can do is hold the hand of someone who’s not, or hope they realize that they’ve passed the same landmark ten times.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18</li> <li>Range: 50</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique has no effect in combat. You may target multiple people with this technique, costing 1 Willpower per additional person who is affected (this extra cost isn’t paid if they defend against it). Someone affected by this technique will find themselves continually walking in circles if they try to travel any appreciable distance (half a mile or more). This lasts for 30 minutes per point you beat their genjutsu roll by. Every hour, they’re allowed a new genjutsu roll against your original result, to see if they notice the effects (although this will not break the technique on its own). Not even something like following a road will work–they’ll wind up wandering off it, the illusion convincing them they’re still on the “road.”</p> <h4 id="-magen-kokoni-arazu-no-jutsu---demon-illusion-false-surroundings-technique-">–( Magen: Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demon Illusion: False Surroundings Technique )–</h4> <p>This jutsu allows the user to change the surroundings around a person subtly, usually used to delay, or force people to walk in circles, unaware that they have stopped going the right way, even messing with ones ability to track the direction they are headed, such as north from south.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 17</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Area: 30</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 15</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Best used out of combat (anyone who sees this being used will realize it’s an illusion), this casts an illusion over an area. This could be making a door appear to be a solid wall, a sign have the wrong number on it, or an intact bridge appear to be broken. When used, make a genjutsu roll with a +5 bonus. Anyone who encounters your illusion makes a genjutsu roll; failure means they believe it’s real, success means they know it’s an illusion. Actually getting rid of it requires the use of Genjustu Kai, though the illusion won’t affect senses other than sight.</p> <h4 id="-nemuri---sleep-">–( Nemuri - Sleep )–</h4> <p>A genjutsu whose greatest limitation is that it requires physical contact, the user places their hand on a target and sends them immediately into a deep slumber. Very nice for infiltration without raising a fuss.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Special: No handseals required</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can’t be used in combat. If you’re able to touch the target and succeed with a genjutsu roll, they immediately fall asleep (it’s a good idea to ease them to the ground, to avoid them, say, bashing their shoulder on a rock and immediately waking themselves back up). Unless they’re woken up (see the Sleep status for details), they’ll be asleep for at least four hours.</p> <h4 id="-senun-no-jutsu---fog-of-war-technique-">–( Sen’un no Jutsu - Fog of War Technique )–</h4> <p>You trap a target in some manner of in-depth hallucination. They may believe that you’ve run away and think they’re giving pursuit, or be convinced that they’re locked in combat with you. This technique is often a last-ditch resort to escape from a superior adversary, or bypass someone when there’s no time to deal with them in direct combat.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 25 + X * 3</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 15</li> <li>Speed: 25</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Using this technique costs 2 Willpower if it succeeds. It has a +X bonus to your Genjutsu roll, up to a maximum of +5. If used successfully, whoever its victim was is left trapped in some manner of hallucination. The target is essentially removed from combat for this technique’s duration. Unfortunately, this technique is particularly fragile. If the target senses danger (such as from an incoming jutsu, or planting explosives around them) it’ll break in time for them to try to avoid it. It lasts for a maximum of 1 minute per 1 point you beat their genjutsu roll by.</p> <h4 id="-shunou-kaimetsu---brain-destruction-">–( Shunou Kaimetsu - Brain Destruction )–</h4> <p>This jutsu convinces the victim that they’ve been grievously injured. Although it causes no actual physical harm, it convinces their mind and all their senses that they’ve suffered some manner of severe damage.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 26</li> <li>Range: 30</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This inflicts a temporary wound on the victim. It’s by default Minor, raised to Major if you beat their genjutsu roll by 5 or more, and Severe if you beat their roll by 10 or more.</p> <p>They interpret this technique as whatever sort of attack or jutsu would be appropriate to cause the injury they believe they’re suffering from. They suffer all normal effects of this injury (and good luck trying to convince them it’s all in their head), aside from Vitality/HP loss or unconsciousness. It lasts until the genjutsu is broken. You choose the damage type and wound location, and can choose to use a lesser category of wound if you wish.</p> <p>The wound may not be prevented, healed, or ignored (such as from Strong Willed), except by ending the Genjutsu. If an effect would heal the wound, or an effect other than armor would prevent it, it does not work, but does make the victim aware that they are under a Genjutsu. The victim derives no benefit from a wound created with Brain Destruction: Kaguya do not gain a Skeletal Modification, Super Novice do not gain a Willpower/etc.</p> <p>Additionally, while any stamina or CE penalties (e.g. Minor Blunt Abdomen wound Winded) and failed fatigue levels (e.g. any wound that causes Suffocation, in the event that the victim fails one of the Stamina checks caused by Suffocation) caused by the wound remain, any instant fatigue (e.g. Severe Piercing Abdomen wound Cavitation) from wounds would disappear when this jutsu ends. This means their fatigue level would be reduced by the amount it had been increased by due to the wound when this jutsu ends; the Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties that were purged by advancing a fatigue level do not return, but any acquired since then remain. Finally, wounds caused by Brain Destruction cannot knock the victim unconscious, whether due to fatigue or as a result of the specific wound. The target can go over their normal fatigue level limit in this manner if it is necessary to maintain consciousness, following the normal bonuses and penalties caused by fatigue levels, only falling unconscious when their real fatigue level without the Brain Destruction wound is sufficient to do so. This inability to knock the victim unconscious does not inherently allow the target to realize they are under a genjutsu.</p> <p>Brain Destruction wounds do not break other genjutsu (as is normal), however, Brain Destruction wounds will break if they are wounded from another source, and will break themselves from repeated applications: If you use Brain Destruction on someone who already has a wound from Brain Destruction, the old wound goes away and is replaced by the new wound when affected by this technique again, which applies both from the same source, and from separate ones (multiple people can’t each apply this technique to one person).</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-gosaru-tatari---five-monkey-curse-">–( Gosaru Tatari - Five Monkey Curse )–</h4> <p>This technique interferes with the victim’s ability to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel pain. Admittedly, the last one’s an undesirable addition to the mix (in most circumstances), butthe technique makes up for that with its all-around usefulness.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This negates all ranks the victim has in Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced Sight, and any abilities dependant upon them (such as Blind Fighting or Genjutsu Awareness). They also suffer a -2 visibility penalty (which stacks with any other visibility penalties they may have). Their reduced sensory perception allows them to ignore the penalties of any Minor wounds they may be suffering from, which also means that minor wounds will not break any other genjutsu applied to them (including this one) while this genjutsu persists.</p> <h4 id="-nemurihane---sleep-feather-">–( Nemurihane - Sleep Feather )–</h4> <p>An advanced version of Nemuri, this causes the subject to briefly see illusory feathers drifting down around them before they succumb to sleep. It’s no more useful in combat, but it can actually be used at a range, or from hiding.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 24</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This functions as the C-rank Nemuri, but may be used at up to the listed range.</p> <h4 id="-magen-nijuu-kokoni-arazu-no-jutsu---demonic-illusion-double-false-surroundings-technique-">–( Magen: Nijuu Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Double False Surroundings Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced technique, this constructs one illusion on top of another. When the outer layer is destroyed, the second will flawlessly take its place and masquerade as reality. Confident that they’ve overcome the deception, most shinobi will have an even harder time realizing that they haven’t done so at all.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: Special</li> <li>Upkeep: +5</li> <li>Speed: +10</li> <li>Seal Speed: +10</li> <li>Requires: False Surroundings Technique</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique can be used with any area of effect genjutsu, adding a second genjutsu on top of it which takes effect only once the first one is ‘dispelled’ or otherwise ended; once the first one is overcome, the second immediately takes effect. The second genjutsu chosen can be an area of effect genjutsu (in which case you use the larger of the two areas), or it can be a targeted one (in which case it affects targets in the order in which they overcome the first illusion, until it can’t target any more people or has no more valid targets, as appropriate), but it can’t be a higher rank than the first. Each Genjutsu is paid for separately, and has +5 to its normal chakra cost, but you use the first genjutsu’s speed and seal speed to determine the final Speed of the action to perform this technique (along with the above additions of +10 to each). If the original genjutsu has no Upkeep, it’s simply an Upkeep 5 to maintain the second genjutsu; otherwise it adds +5 to the original genjutsu’s Upkeep, which can be ended at any time (independent of this upkeep), causing anyone still suffering from the first genjutsu to have it ‘end’ for them automatically, and then making them roll and applying the second genjutsu’s effects.</p> <p>As part of this technique, you can choose to apply a penalty to the first genjutsu, to a maximum of -5, to gain an equivalent bonus to the second genjutsu’s roll. You can choose to use the same technique twice in this way (layering an Oboro bunshin on top of an Oboro bunshin, for example), but can not lower the first roll to gain a bonus on the second in such a case. Regardless of which genjutsu you use, both techniques are considered ‘used’ for the purposes of future defenses against those techniques in the same battle.</p> <h4 id="-magen-jubaku-satsu---demon-illusion-tree-binding-death-">–( Magen: Jubaku Satsu - Demon Illusion: Tree Binding Death )–</h4> <p>This genjutsu makes its unfortunate victim believe that a large tree has suddenly grown behind them through the use of some manner of ninjutsu, and pinned them against its trunk by exceptionally-strong, chakra-animated branches.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> <li>Special: Immobilize 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Every 10 IC which pass the victim is allowed another defensive genjutsu roll against your original roll, at a cumulative +1, to realize that this is only an illusion. While this genjutsu is maintained, the victim can not move from where they are, anchored in place to the tree (even if they reduce the immobilization penalty).</p> <p>Because the Immobility penalty is a genjutsu, however, other effects which move the target (such as Wind God’s Breath, or any Knockback) work like normal. Being moved does not mean they can automatically realize they’re in a genjutsu, as the target’s mind is sufficiently tricked to not notice the contradiction from movement alone.</p> <h4 id="-jigyaku-no-jutsu---time-reversal-technique-">–( Jigyaku no Jutsu - Time Reversal Technique )–</h4> <p>Used on willing recipitants, this jutsu puts the target in a trance like state, and keeps them hypnotized, to uncover forgotten memories or past events. Its often used to uncover important details that have been missed or forgotten on missions, or to help shinobi make 100% accurate reports on the most important of missions, rarely on unimportant missions.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 26</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can only be used on helpless or willing recipients. It places the subject into a trance-like state, similar to hypnosis. It causes them to recall any suppressed memories, and can help remember details they might otherwise have forgotten. Mechanically, this will unravel the effects of the A-rank Sennou Sousa no Jutsu, and gives a +5 bonus to Research rolls made to remember details about a previous experience (such as glancing around a room and needing to recall its contents). It will also uncover any memories suppressed due to trauma or similar causes. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on what it’s being used for, how deeply buried the hidden memories are, and how much information needs to be remembered. This technique may only be used on a given person once per day.</p> <h4 id="-magen-tetsuotome-no-jutsu---demonic-illusion-iron-maiden-technique-">–( Magen: Tetsuotome no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Iron Maiden Technique )–</h4> <p>Chains burst from the ground beneath the victim and wrap around their legs, anchoring them in place, followed by two halves of an iron maiden, either on each side of the victim or in front of and behind them. The iron maiden slams shut with them in it, causing excruciating pain and a slew of debilitating injuries.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 18</li> <li>Special: Stun 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This temporarily inflicts a Minor Piercing wound on every location of the opponent’s body (Torso, Abdomen, and both arms and legs). If the target fails by 10 or more, this is upgraded to a Major Piercing Wound on every location. These wounds last for the duration of the illusion, though the full Stun will remain even if it’s broken early. Rules for these wounds are the same as described in Brain Destruction.</p> <h4 id="-sakki---killing-intent-">–( Sakki - Killing Intent )–</h4> <p>A side-effect of learning how to control chakra is the ability to sense, and exude, what shinobi refer to as killing intent. More powerful shinobi can project it more strongly, and even send lesser ninja running with just a glance. This genjutsu simulates an intense blast of paralyzingly strong killing intent in an attempt to overwhelm its target.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Range: 15</li> <li>Special: Stun 10 + X</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You and your target must have line of sight with one another, and neither can be suffering from a visibility penalty of -6 or greater. X is the amount the victim failed their Genjutsu dodge roll by, and until the stun has ended, all defensive interrupts have their base speed doubled, though they can’t have them increased further (such as by Shock). The stun is cut short if the jutsu ends early. This technique doesn’t require handseals.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-nehan-shouja-no-jutsu---temple-of-nirvana-technique-">–( Nehan Shouja no Jutsu - Temple of Nirvana Technique )–</h4> <p>The most powerful version of Nemuri, used for putting a large group of people to sleep. Nothing short of extremely loud noises, being shaken awake, several hours passing, or similar situations will wake them up, allowing victims to be bound, moved, or completely ignored. This move is again, useless in combat.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Range: 150</li> <li>Area: 100</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Anyone in the area who fails their genjutsu roll falls asleep. Anyone with less than half the user’s total XP automatically fails unless they spend a point of Willpower to be allowed to actually roll it (that roll does not gain the normal effects of benefitting from Willpower being spent on it, unless they spend another point). Like Nemuri, it does not work on targets engaged in combat, and victims will be asleep for several hours unless awoken.</p> <h4 id="-kokuangyo-no-jutsu---bringer-of-darkness-technique-">–( Kokuangyo no Jutsu - Bringer-of-Darkness Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique specifically targets the victim’s eyesight, effectively blinding them and allowing its user to attack with impunity.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 40</li> <li>Range: 50</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 26</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This applies a -10 visibility penalty to the victim. While it’s in effect, anyone can attempt to hide from them (even if the victim can somehow reduce that penalty below -6). While in effect, any doujutsu the victim possesses is effectively useless, and grants them no benefits, and anything requiring the use of that doujutsu (such as other techniques) can not be utilized.</p> <h4 id="-kiokure-keiren---nervous-convulsions-">–( Kiokure Keiren - Nervous Convulsions )–</h4> <p>This technique partially hijacks the victim’s nervous system, reacting in response to anything they do and sending conflicting signals. It’s only truly effective in combat, where physical activity is the most spontaneous, and even slightly reduced reaction time can prove fatal. This tends to be exceptionally painful.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 35</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 27</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Whenever the target takes a non-interrupt action while under this technique’s effects, they suffer a Paralysis and Shock of X/5, which lasts for (X*2) IC. X is the speed of the action taken. Every time they take the listed status effects from this genjutsu, they are allowed another genjutsu defense with a cumulative +1 bonus against the original genjutsu offense. Success ends this genjutsu and prevents further Paralysis and Shock status effects from being applied by it, but does not remove any status effects currently applied unless they beat the original roll by 10 or more.</p> <h4 id="-sennou-sousa-no-jutsu---memory-concealing-manipulative-sand-technique-">–( Sennou Sousa no Jutsu - Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique allows the user to alter or conceal the subject’s memories. While it’s not permanent, the change can be either subtle (believing they were incapacitated and left unconscious, rather than incapacitated and then interrogated), or about as much so as a sledgehammer (erasing the past two days of their memory).</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 44</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 30</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may only be used on a helpless or willing subject. On a willing recipient, the technique is incredibly potent: It can suppress virtually any amount of a person’s memories, and can even be used to alter existing memories or create wholly fabricated ones. One popular way of using the technique is to implant false memories of a person choosing to defect (and suppressing ones of them coming up with this plan) and then using them as a double-agent, working alongside and gathering intel from the enemy until the technique is undone at the right moment for them to change back to their original allegiance. Indeed, this jutsu is one of the more pragmatic reasons for most villages not trusting missing nin defectors.</p> <p>On a helpless and unwilling target, the jutsu’s efficacy is greatly reduced. An opposed genjutsu roll is made, and “X” is determined as the amount this technique’s user succeeded by. Up to X hours worth of memories, in the past X days, can be erased. The greatest limitation is the user’s knowledge. “Your meeting with the daimyo” could be targeted for erasure, but there’s no way of knowing if the target also received secret orders after that meeting. “Finding us here”, and “the past few hours” are reasonably common uses. No matter how extreme this technique is, it can’t alter one’s subconscious. You cannot forget abilities, jutsu, or your name. You might forget a person you met, but they’d always be slightly familiar.</p> <p>Although a person could be afflicted with multiple instances of this genjutsu, it can only be applied once per week. Genjutsu Kai will not remove this technique, nor will being wounded. When you apply this technique, make a Genjutsu Offense roll: Anyone other than you attempting to unravel it (such as with the B-rank Jigyaku no Jutsu) has to roll at least that high when they attempt to do so (using their Genjutsu Offense), or they won’t even notice this technique’s presence. Similarly, Byakugan is unable to detect the presence of this technique on someone.</p> <h4 id="-dokushin-no-jutsu---poison-truth-technique-">–( Dokushin no Jutsu - Poison Truth Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique traps the victim in a state of dream-like hallucination. In that state, the technique’s user can try to pry information from them, in the form of questions, which the subject will then (coherently, and audibly) mumble the answer to. Unlike torture, this technique leaves no physical marks, and the victims will not remember what information they revealed or managed to kept secret. It often takes longer than torture to extract usable information, but it’s much more reliable because the subject can’t lie. Multiple, especially consecutive, uses of this technique can leave a victim traumatized without knowing why–indeed, even the users aren’t entirely sure what kind of hallucinations the victim experiences. While it’s not quite a forbidden technique, using it is considered extremely morally ambiguous.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 40</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 50</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique may only be used on a helpless victim, and when used immediately puts them to sleep. The genjutsu user must then focus for the victim’s maximum Willpower in hours. The interrogator asks one question up to twelve words long, and an opposed genjutsu roll is made.</p> <p>If the interrogator succeeds, the subject must answer the question truthfully and without obfuscation (To the question, ‘Where is the scroll?’, “In the castle” would not be a legitimate answer, but “In my room in the castle” would). The subject only has to answer the question asked, not the question intended. Alternately, they may spend a point of Willpower and automatically succeed against a given question.</p> <p>If the interrogator fails, the subject does not have to answer that question.</p> <p>This jutsu is often used in succession by interrogators: Each time it is used, a single question is asked. When used against the same target repeatedly, the subject gets a +2 bonus on future genjutsu rolls against this technique, unless they spent a point of Willpower to automatically avoid answering a question. So long as this bonus lasts, the following questions cannot be asked:</p> <ul> <li>Any question that they’ve previously been asked during that session.</li> <li>A rewording of a previous question (“Who was that person?” instead of “Who was that man?”, for example)</li> </ul> <p>If the victim does not know the answer to a question, that question is simply wasted. The cumulative bonus to defend against this technique lasts for the victim’s maximum Willpower in days. A person won’t begin to regain Willpower (spent defending against this technique, or for any other reason) until at least 24 hours have passed without Dokushin no Jutsu being used upon them.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
