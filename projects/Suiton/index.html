It’s not terribly practical, but it does provide about a quarter-second of a distraction.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: +3</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used alongside a Dodge action, and provides it with a +3 bonus.</p> <h4 id="-mizu-souzou-no-jutsu---water-creation-technique-">–( Mizu Souzou no Jutsu - Water Creation Technique )–</h4> <p>You convert raw chakra into pure water. This technique is popular among serious users of suiton techniques, as it lets them avoid picking and choosing their battles so carefully, and allows them to eschew the practice of carrying around large gourds of water (which, in addition to giving away their specialty, are unpleasantly heavy).</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: X</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 5</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create X gallons of water which are added to the battlefield, to a maximum of 4+(Chakra Control ranks)/5; the Chakra cost has a minimum of 5. This may be used alongside a technique, adding its Chakra cost, Speed and Seal Speed to that technique’s, and it contributes directly to that technique’s gallon requirements.</p> <h4 id="-haneru---splash-">–( Haneru - Splash )–</h4> <p>You use Splash!</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> <li>Seal Speed: 2</li> <li>Tags: ?!</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Nothing happens!</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-teppoudama---liquid-bullet-">–( Teppoudama - Liquid Bullet )–</h4> <p>The user kneads chakra and converts it into water inside their stomach, then spits it out in the form of a dense, chakra-propelled ball. Its greatest boon to suiton users is that it can be used to create water while attacking, opening up other Suiton techniques.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Damage: 6d10+20</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 7</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Adds 4 gallons of water to the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-takigakure-ryu-mizukiri-no-yaiba---hidden-waterfall-style-water-cutting-blade-">–( Takigakure Ryu, Mizukiri no Yaiba - Hidden Waterfall Style, Water-Cutting Blade )–</h4> <p>Originally developed by the Hidden Waterfall village, this technique has since spread into wider use. The first half of the name is generally dropped, though some choose to keep it out of respect. The jutsu creates a blade out of water, kept as strong as most metals by the chakra infusing it.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: (weapon dice)/2 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Nintaijutsu, Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You acquire a sword, with the appropriate attributes for any of the ones in the Equipment chapter. Attacks with this sword use your physical or ninjutsu damage bonus, whichever you prefer, and can have its damage bonus changed (between ninjutsu or physical) for any attack made with it. You may perform handseals while holding this sword at no penalty if it is one-handed (or if you can make seals one-handed), or at a -6 penalty if it is two-handed. This weapon persists until you let go of it.</p> <h4 id="-kirigakure-no-jutsu---hidden-mist-technique-">–( Kirigakure no Jutsu - Hidden Mist Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique was once a specialty of the village it’s named after, but has since fallen into wider use. The user diffuses a large quantity of water into the air, mixing their chakra with it to create a thick, oppressive mist.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Area: 25</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This imposes a -3 Visibility Penalty to everyone in the area, which increases by 1 per 10 IC it’s maintained, to a maximum penalty of -6. So long as you maintain its upkeep, if its Visibility Penalty is ever reduced, it will return at the same rate; effects which would remove it entirely (such as Kitakaze) do, however, remove it. The gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield while its Upkeep is maintained, and when this technique ends, only half of its gallons are added back to the battlefield (the other half is simply destroyed). The area is centered on you, and moves with you.</p> <h4 id="-mizutamari-no-jutsu---pool-of-water-technique-">–( Mizutamari no Jutsu - Pool of Water Technique )–</h4> <p>A moderately advanced technique is the appropriately named water-walking technique; molding chakra below one’s feet to ‘stand’ on patches of water without any actual expenditure of energy, and, once it’s perfected, only minimal concentration. This technique builds upon that concept, creating a ‘cushion’ of static, almost-solid water beneath each foot that the ninja stands on to avoid direct contact with the ground.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water, 10 Chakra Control</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You reduce any Ground or terrain-based immobilization penalties by 4, and ignore any other mechanical effects (such as damage for walking across caltrops) if they’re C-rank or lower. This does mean that you are not directly in contact with the ground (for the purposes of, say, the Doton jutsu Shindou and Yurokensei).</p> <h4 id="-gyoushuu-no-tebukuro---gloves-of-cohesion-">–( Gyoushuu no Tebukuro - Gloves of Cohesion )–</h4> <p>You mold chakra around your palms to maintain a thick film of water around them, similar to how it’s possible for a ninja with excellent chakra control to stand on walls, or, well, water. This uses an extension of that sort of chakra control, using the water film as a medium to latch on to other people.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water, 10 Chakra Control</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This gives you a +4 bonus to all grapple rolls you make (though it does not apply to weapons, or Kagemane), for any purpose other than escaping a grapple. This doesn’t apply to ninjutsu-based grapples, or grapples which are performed by weapons or objects.</p> <h4 id="-mekkyaku---extinguishment-">–( Mekkyaku - Extinguishment )–</h4> <p>While most shinobi pay no attention to water that’s pooling around them on the battlefield, a clever genin that hated being set on fire developed this technique to put a stop to all that! In the process, they also realized that the process of gathering it was also useful to keep others from doing the same, and thus, this technique was made instantly hated by all of those who have only the smallest talent with Suiton, as masters of it tend to enjoy maintaining their control over their element.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 8 + X</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: X*2 gallons of water from the battlefield</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique allows you gain control over the water used in it for the next (Chakra Control ranks) * 2 IC, or until you use it in a jutsu, as if you’d carried it into battle with you (meaning, no one else may use, access, convert or destroy it in this time).</p> <p>When you use this technique, you can also immediately choose to reduce any Ignites you’re currently afflicted by, by dousing yourself in the water as part of this technique’s use. This reduces any Ignites you are suffering from by X, and destroys (X * 2) gallons of water to do so.</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-suikoudan---water-shark-blast-">–( Suikoudan - Water Shark Blast )–</h4> <p>After creating the handseals, you launch water in projectile form at an opponent. Some ninja like to etch the outline of a shark’s head into the end of this projectile; others, who believe that being a ninja is very serious business, prefer to omit that part of the technique. Experienced users can even use this to allow themselves to fly quickly through the water, while protecting themselves with the might of the tearing shark.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Damage: 12d12+45</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 13</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique travels in a line from you to its target. You may move a number of yards equal to the final Speed of this attack along that line as part of this technique (in place of your normal attack-move distance), unhindered by anything which would normally slow (but not prevent) you from moving. The gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-mizurappa---violent-water-wave-">–( Mizurappa - Violent Water Wave )–</h4> <p>Inhaling a large amount of air and performing the necessary seals, the user will expel a copious amount of water from his/her mouth. The wave of water produced will slam against its opponent and can then be utilized for other techniques.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Damage: 12d10+24</li> <li>Range: 15</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Adds 8 gallons of water to the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-suiben---water-whip-">–( Suiben - Water Whip )–</h4> <p>This creates, as its name suggests, a whip made from water which is held together by chakra. Aside from being a fairly useful weapon, it can prove useful for binding enemies, as the user can direct its motions with their chakra.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18</li> <li>Upkeep: 3</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Nintaijutsu, Slashing, Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create a whip made out of water. It is a Stamina 11, Damage 6d10, Speed 10, Range 8 Melee Slashing Chain weapon. It uses the higher of your Ninjutsu or Physical Damage Bonus. You may perform handseals while holding the whip at no penalty. As a Speed 10 action, you may use the whip to grab hold of someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your NDB in place of PDB for grapple checks using the whip, with a +3 bonus.</p> <p>Grappling someone with this weapon does not impose a penalty on your own Dodge or Parry interrupts, though the whip can not be used for anything else while the grapple is maintained. Ignite statuses do not transfer between grapplers. You must keep ahold of the weapon to maintain the grapple. The person you’re grappling can not move further away from you than this weapon’s range: if they would do something that would move them further, you are moved as well (and vice-versa), and either may attempt to restrain the other (as described under Grab). You can always elect to end the grapple by simply ending the upkeep, whether or not you are in control of the grapple. If you ever let go of the weapon (or are disarmed of it), the upkeep ends automatically. Someone grappled by the Whip can not use Shift Grapple, but Reversal functions as normal. You can use the whip to perform any valid Grapple techniques you know of C-rank or below, except for Headbutt, Suplex, and Pressure Point, replacing the technique’s normal Stamina cost with an equivalent Chakra Exhaustion cost. Joint Lock uses the whip’s damage instead of unarmed attack damage. It is considered to have unlimited limbs. You may direct Raiton techniques through the whip: This may be done with E and D-rank techniques. It may also be done with a C-rank technique, but doing so destroys the whip in the process. These techniques can not be dodged or parried (as they’re being grappled by the whip), but can be blocked.</p> <h4 id="-mizuame-nabara---syrup-capture-field-">–( Mizuame Nabara - Syrup Capture Field )–</h4> <p>The user converts chakra into water, and infuses it with enough chakra to alter its composition, making it extremely viscous. They then spit it out in a stream of sticky, highly adhesive liquid.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Area: 20</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: 7 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental, Ground</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Everyone within the area of this technique takes a -4 Immobilization penalty; anyone with the Water Walking ability instead only takes a -2 penalty, which remains until you leave its area. This technique’s effects remain regardless of whether you maintain its Upkeep, however while you do maintain it, you can control the syrup field to make it ‘grab’ someone within its area, making a grapple roll using your NDB in place of PDB against them (with you as the attacker) as a Speed 8 action; if you succeed, they are caught and take the full -4 Immobilization penalty regardless of whether or not they have the Water Walking ability.</p> <p>The water used in this technique is considered used up and is never added back to the battlefield after use.</p> <h4 id="-mizu-bunshin-no-jutsu---water-clone-technique-">–( Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu - Water Clone Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced form of the standard Bunshin no Jutsu, this creates clones out of water. Since they’re solid (well, relatively) these clones can be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for themselves. While they’re weaker than their user, they can still prove dangerous in combat.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12, +3 per clone</li> <li>Speed: 10, +1 per clone</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone</li> <li>Requires: 6 gallons of water per clone, Bunshin no Jutsu</li> <li>Tags: Clone</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The gallons of water used to create clones are removed from the battlefield as they are made; clones which are dispersed voluntarily have the water used to create them added back to the battlefield, but clones that are destroyed do not, and the water used in their creation is simply lost. These function like regular bunshin, except that they can dodge and parry, have (and pay for) their own Fatigue costs, they use your NDB in place of PDB wherever applicable, and may perform the following additional actions:</p> <ul> <li>[ X AP ] Move: Your clones can move, with X being half the speed of the Move action they take.</li> <li>[ X AP ] Basic Unarmed: A basic unarmed attack, using your attributes. X is half the Speed of the attack.</li> <li>[ X AP ] Basic Weapon: You may add melee weapons to Mizu Bunshin when they’re created by expending more gallons of water, paying +1 gallon per 4 dice of weaponry you give them, rounded up, to a maximum of (NDB/3) weapons. They may attack with those weapons, using your abilities. X is half the Speed of the attack.</li> <li>[ 10 AP ] The clone can use itself to create a water prison (as per Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu), as a Speed 12 action at its normal CE cost. The clone uses is own gallons of war to contribute to the gallons required for Suirou no Jutsu, but if it does not have enough, it must create more as part of the action in order to perform Suirou no Jutsu. The clone remains present, but follows the normal restrictions for maining the water prison, as described in Suirou no Jutsu. The clone, and the prison, last for 10 + (Chakra Control Ranks/2) IC, after which the clone is destroyed and the prison ends unless you or another water clone touches the water prison to maintain it, taking on its normal upkeep and restrictions.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-mizugakure-no-jutsu---hidden-in-water-technique-">–( Mizugakure no Jutsu - Hidden in Water Technique )–</h4> <p>The user sinks into a shallow pool of water, much too little to actually fit a person (it’s ninja magic, don’t ask questions), where they’ll be able to easily lie in wait for a target to pass by, or spy on someone who might be near.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: A pool of water of at least 16 gallons</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can use this technique to slip into a pool of water to hide, assuming you meet hiding’s normal requirements (i.e., this technique does not let you hide in itself). While hidden within the water using this technique, your minimum Stealth level is 2. If an opponent does not have a reason to suspect you’re there (i.e. this isn’t being done in-combat) you have a +10 Stealth bonus. You have awareness equivalent to being able to look out of the pool as if it’s a window, but obviously can not move (because you’re in the water!) The puddle being destroyed, evaporated, used in a jutsu or attacked in any way or washed away in more water, results in you being harmlessly ejected. Notably, this can only be used in puddles; anything more than a few inches deep probably doesn’t qualify. If it’s an actual pond, or lake, or the like, it’s not a valid target.</p> <h4 id="-suirou-no-jutsu---water-prison-technique-">–( Suirou no Jutsu - Water Prison Technique )–</h4> <p>The user gathers the chakra around their hand, and forms the required water into a sphere which encloses its victim. Due to the density of the chakra used in this technique, the water is stronger than steel. It is not, however, airtight. Yeah, don’t ask how that works. We don’t know either.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 22</li> <li>Upkeep: 5</li> <li>Range: Melee</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Melee</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You trap your target inside a sphere of water. Someone inside cannot take actions, but they also cannot be affected by anything outside the prison; yes, that’s right, the water can even stop giant swords. It makes sense, honestly, we promise, somehow. Anyone with a Chakra Control skill of 5 or above is able to mold the chakra around them to allow themselves to siphon air through the prison, meaning they can still talk and breathe. Anyone with less, however, adds a Suffocation 1 status every 10 IC. You must keep one hand on the water prison to maintain it, and you can not move or dodge while maintaining it; if you choose to dodge against an incoming attack, the water prison automatically ends, and the person inside is no longer protected (including from the attack itself, if it would likewise affect them), though they may defend normally.</p> <p>If you take damage while maintaining the water prison, you must make a Chakra Control check against (damage taken)/10 or the prison ends; if a clone is destroyed while using Water Prison, and the attack itslf would also include the person inside the prison (say, from an AoE), then the person inside the water prison must also defend against the attack, and is not protected from it by the Water Prison. Although you can’t move, you can still take most other actions that are possible one-handed while maintaining the prison’s upkeep.</p> <p>If used against someone in a grapple, this technique automatically fails unless the person(s) in control of the grapple opt to let go as it is used.</p> <h4 id="-takitsubo-no-jutsu-water-release-waterfall-basin-technique-">–( Takitsubo no Jutsu: Water Release: Waterfall Basin Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique draws water up from underground, forming a geyser on the surface. Aside from being useful for creating a spot to relax when resting or camping out, and ensuring you’ll always have a source of clean (well… for a certain value of clean) water, it, like most ninjutsu, has combat applications.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 24</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 18</li> <li>Tags: Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This produces 2 gallon of water on the battlefield every 3 IC, for a total of 50 gallons over 75 IC. It’s certainly possible to have multiple instances of this jutsu running simultaneously, from multiple people, or the same person.</p> <h4 id="-umi-no-tate-no-jutsu---ocean-shield-technique-">–( Umi no Tate no Jutsu - Ocean Shield Technique )–</h4> <p>A derivative of a more advanced technique, this was created to help teach up-and-coming suiton users the foundations of that jutsu, and help keep them alive until they were skilled enough to learn it. It creates a circular barrier of water around you, which surges up to protect you from… well, whatever convinced you that you’d need to use this technique.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 17</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Make an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of NDB/2 or this technique’s final, modified Speed, whichever is lower. If you meet or exceed the attack’s accuracy, you protect yourself from it completely. This works against Katon up to B rank, Doton up to D-rank, and all other jutsu (including Taijutsu) up to C-rank, and uses up a number of gallons equal to twice the rank of the technique it’s used against, which are removed from the battlefield thereafter (basic attacks, however, do not have any gallons of water lost in this way).</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-suigadan---water-fang-bullet-">–( Suigadan - Water Fang Bullet )–</h4> <p>This move forms multiple pressurized, spiralling columns of water that have a drill-like ability to pierce and destroy their target. As this attack can originate from any body of water (rather than being shot directly from the attacker), in the right environments this has a 360 degree range of attack, making it incredibly difficult to defend against adequately.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Damage: 12d20 + 80</li> <li>Range: 30</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons</li> <li>Tags: Piercing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Once per battle, you can choose to ‘use up’ the gallons of water used in this technique in order to make an automatic Surprise Attack, removing them from the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-suiryuudan---water-dragon-blast-">–( Suiryuudan - Water Dragon Blast )–</h4> <p>This technique shapes a large amount of water into a giant, dragon-shaped projectile which seeks out and crashes into whoever you direct it at. What it lacks for in complexity, it makes up for by being a highly effective tool in any suiton using shinobi’s arsenal.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 33</li> <li>Damage: 14d20+140</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 22</li> <li>Status: Stun 10</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Half the gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-suijinheki---water-encampment-wall-">–( Suijinheki - Water Encampment Wall )–</h4> <p>This defensive technique creates a wall of water around you, which forms a violently churning defensive perimeter. When lacking water in the environment to use, a talented shinobi can form it in their stomach and spit it out.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 26</li> <li>Special: Interrupt, Abort</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: 10 + NDB*2 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If using Suijinheki as an interrupt: Make an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of half your ninjutsu damage bonus or this technique’s final, modified Speed, whichever is lower. Once Suijinheki has been deployed, it lasts for your NDB in IC (whether your defense succeeded or failed), stopping any other incoming attacks automatically without having to roll. Anytime after the initial attack, you may Abort this technique, which is necessary if you need to move or attack through it. This technique protects you from any Katon up to A-rank, Doton up to C-rank, and all other techniques (including taijutsu) up to B-rank, and uses up a number of gallons equal to twice the rank of the technique it’s first used against, plus 2 gallons per IC it’s deployed, which are removed from the battlefield thereafter (basic attacks, however, do not have any gallons of water lost in this way). If the full gallons of water used in the technique are destroyed by it preventing attacks, it is automatically aborted early.</p> <h4 id="-bakusui-shouha---exploding-water-shockwave-">–( Bakusui Shouha - Exploding Water Shockwave )–</h4> <p>The user creates an enormous amount of water by spewing it from their mouth, flooding the battlefield and potentially crushing foes in its path. Best of all, they get to look awesome while doing it! The wave rises up from beneath the user, and they can ‘ride’ it to its destination.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Damage: 15d12 + 45</li> <li>Area: Half the number of gallons created</li> <li>Speed: 16, cannot be reduced below 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> <li>Status: Stun 8</li> <li>Special: Can not be dodged.</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This adds 40 + (NDB * 4) gallons of water to the battlefield every time it is used. When performing this technique, you may move a number of yards equal to its final Speed, in any direction. The Area itself is centered on where you start your movement.</p> <h4 id="-benzaiten-no-jutsu---river-goddess-technique-">–( Benzaiten no Jutsu - River Goddess Technique )–</h4> <p>Named after the deity who supposedly watches over a major river, this technique coats the user’s body with a thin layer of chakra-infused water. It offers no real protection from impacts or weapons, but can be an effective supplement to one’s defenses against heat and other unpleasantness.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: So long as this is maintained you cannot be affected by Ignite or Burn statuses, and you take 25% less damage from Katon jutsu (applied after other reductions). Activating it will end any ongoing Ignites harmlessly, but will not cure Burns.</p> <h4 id="-suishi-no-jutsu---water-drowning-technique-">–( Suishi no Jutsu - Water Drowning Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced version of the ever-popular Water Prison Technique, this remedies the greatest flaw in that technique: a lack of lethality. It does… about what it says. In terms of appearances, it’s almost identical to a regular water prison.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Upkeep: 8</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Melee</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This follows all normal rules for the Water Prison Technique, with the following exceptions: The victim suffers from Suffocation 1 every 5 IC regardless of their Chakra Control, and by spending 1 Willpower, they are allowed a 1d20+CHA/10+(5 per Fatigue category) roll against your 1d20+CHA/10+(ninjutsu damage bonus). They also get one such check whenever they advance a Fatigue category inside the prison, and when you first strike them with it. Success means they break free.</p> <h4 id="-uramiame---grudge-rain-">–( Uramiame - Grudge Rain )–</h4> <p>As a weather-manipulation jutsu, this technique is extremely taxing upon its user. Upon its completion a large storm cloud is created, which proceeds to, as storm clouds are prone to do, rain. This rain saps the chakra from anyone it comes in contact with, and transfers it through the pooling water to the technique’s user.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Upkeep: 6</li> <li>Area: CHA/2</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: 32 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Every 5 IC, everyone other than the user and up to (Chakra Control)/5 people they’ve designated as allies has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty increased by 1, and the user has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty decreased by 1, so long as at least one person had their CE penalty increased. This remains centered on the user as they move.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-daibakufu---great-waterfall-">–( Daibakufu - Great Waterfall )–</h4> <p>This is one of the most powerful water ninjutsu in existence; once the appropriate seals are formed, the user unleashes a devastating tidal wave which tears across the battlefield like a scaled-down tsunami, knocking aside people, trees, and small buildings in its path. Long ago, exceptionally skilled shinobi were able to fill their impromptu waterfall with all manner of weapons, which were propelled within the wave at incredible speeds. This had the effect of making it an almost unavoidably deadly technique that would leave pools of blood mixed in with the water. However, use of that aspect of the technique was forbidden due to its unbelievable power, and as peace settled across the lands the secret of how to do that was lost.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 42</li> <li>Damage: 24d20+300</li> <li>Range: 80</li> <li>Area: 40 wide, up to max range in length; may be used as a smaller area if you wish</li> <li>Speed: 30</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> <li>Requires: 100 gallons of water</li> <li>Status: Stun 18</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield, scattered as a fine mist over the area; if the gallon requirement is somehow removed, this technique’s Chakra cost is increased by 18. Blocking reduces this technique’s Stun by half.</p> <h4 id="-daikoudan---great-shark-blast-">–( Daikoudan - Great Shark Blast )–</h4> <p>This creates an enormous shark out of water and sends it crashing across the battlefield at whichever party has offended the user sufficiently for them to feel the need to do so. Aside from impacting its primary target, the shark is massive enough to cause significant collateral damage. The technique’s true secret, however, is its ability to absorb any chakra it comes in contact with and use that energy to further empower itself.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Damage: 15d20+200</li> <li>Range: 50</li> <li>Area: 16</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 26</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If used as an Interrupt, you may choose to reduce this technique’s Seal Speed by 10 and increase its Chakra cost by 10. You can choose to use more than the required amount of gallons of water for this technique, adding 2 points of damage per extra gallon used; all gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield afterward. Used as a normal attack, it does full damage to a single target, and half damage to everyone else within its Area (including you, if you are in it).</p> <p>As an Interrupt, it can be used to counter any damage-dealing ranged ninjutsu attack. Daikoudan may be used to Interrupt techniques so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs. The two attacks collide, and their damage is compared. For this comparison, treat Katon technqiues as dealing 25% less damage, and Doton as dealing 25% more. If the incoming attack does more damage, you are hit by it, but it has its damage reduced by half. If Daikoudan’s damage is greater, it becomes an attack against the opponent with +5 Accuracy, along with any Accuracy bonuses (but not penalties) of the attack it countered. It does an additional (X * 10) damage, where X is the Chakra cost of the move it countered. Similarly, if a non-Doton ninjutsu-based defense is used against Daikoudan, and fails to stop it completely, it does full damage (bypassing partial success) and adds (X * 10) damage, with X being the Chakra cost of the failed defense; against Doton defenses, it still does full damage if the defense fails to stop it, but it does not gain damage based upon the Chakra cost of the failed defense.</p> <h4 id="-dai-bakusui-shouha---great-exploding-water-shockwave-">–( Dai Bakusui Shouha - Great Exploding Water Shockwave )–</h4> <p>A stronger version of the B-rank Exploding Water Shockwave, the user spits out a truly prodigious amount of water.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30 + X</li> <li>Upkeep: 8</li> <li>Area: 20 + X * 3</li> <li>Speed: 26</li> <li>Seal Speed: 32</li> <li>Status: Stun 20</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental, Ground</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This adds (100+ X * 20) gallons of water to the battlefield. X has a maximum of your Chakra Control ranks. Unlike other Suiton techniques, you can use the water from this technique even while maintaining its upkeep. So long as you maintain its Upkeep and there are least 300 gallons of water on the battlefield, all other Ground-tagged techniques (such as Syrup Capture Field, or Retsudotensho) are effectively useless, as the water forms a flattened orb over the affected area, with the user anchored at its center. The water orb will follow them, and the below effects will be maintained (when the upkeep ends, so do they, as the water disperses over a much larger area): Anyone who can’t stand on water will begin to sink into the orb, and is forced to swim (at half their normal movement speed, unaided by normal movement-increasing techniques), and until they exit the area, they suffer a Suffocation 1 every 10 IC. Someone forced to swim in this way can take a Speed 5 action to keep themselves at the surface of the water, preventing them from gaining any Suffocation status from this technique for 15 IC.</p> <h4 id="-hijutsu-kirisame---secret-technique-mist-rain-">–( Hijutsu: Kirisame - Secret Technique: Mist Rain )–</h4> <p>This technique causes it to start raining over a small (well, for… rain) area. This rain is chakra-infused, and will siphon away any chakra which doesn’t match its own (in other words, its creator’s); fallen rain evaporates rapidly, only to fall again, and shrouds the area in a thick mist.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Upkeep: 10</li> <li>Area: CHA</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> <li>Requires: 100 gallons of water</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Any jutsu which is used inside the mist, or includes the mist as any part of its area, acts as if its user’s ninjutsu damage bonus is 0 for any assocaited damage calculations. Additionally, this imposes a -8 visibility penalty to everyone in the area. You suffer only half the normal visibility penalty.</p> <p>If you move, the rain moves with you; due to its massive area and associated visibility penalty, it’s impossible for others to track you by the rain’s movement. This mist is immune to lower-rank effects which would reduce its Visibility Penalty (such as the E-Rank Fuuton Cleansing Winds), but effects which would remove it entirely (such as the A-Rank Fuuton, The North Wind), will, indeed, remove it. If Mist Rain ends because you stop paying the Upkeep, the damage bonus reduction immediately ends, but the visibility penalty will remain for the next 80 IC (as the rain finishes falling), reducing its Severity by 1 per 10 IC. This technique may only be used outside (and anyone inside within its area is immune to its effects).</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
