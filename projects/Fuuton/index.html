It’s still useful, for a sufficiently resourceful ninja.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 7</li> <li>Range: 5</li> <li>Area: 10</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Seal Speed: 7</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This reduces any existing Environmental Visibility Penalties by 2. Repeated uses of this jutsu will reduce them further, potentially eliminating them entirely.</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-kazekiri---wind-cutter-">–( Kazekiri - Wind Cutter )–</h4> <p>The user generates a narrow arc of wind and chakra, which is sent out to cut things like ropes, lines, and people.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 13</li> <li>Damage: 2d4 * 5</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Tags: Slashing, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique’s damage is considered 50% higher for Wounding purposes.</p> <h4 id="-hineri-dangan---twister-shot-">–( Hineri Dangan - Twister Shot )–</h4> <p>Holding their hand half-grasped, the user blows a constant stream of wind into their hand which begins to spiral around in a ball or small tornado shape. The tornado is then sent out toward the target as the hand is opened.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Damage: 4d4 * 5</li> <li>Range: 15</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Status: 5 yard Knockback</li> <li>Tags: Slashing, Projectile</li> </ul> <h4 id="-shikisetsufuu-shou---four-seasonal-winds-palm-">–( Shikisetsufuu Shou - Four Seasonal Winds Palm )–</h4> <p>In a fashion similar to how ninja knead chakra into their palms and feet to stick to walls and ceilings, you gather wind elemental chakra, but project and hold it just beyond your body to supplement your unarmed strikes.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> <li>Tags: Nintaijutsu, Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: While this technique’s upkeep is maintained, all your non-grapple unarmed attacks inflict a Knockback of (NDB/2, rounding down) yards, and allow you the option to ‘chase’ (and remain at range 0) with the primary target of your attack (if it’s an AoE, pick one target to chase) after knocking them back, ignoring ground effects as you do so. Additionally, parries against such attacks take a -2 to their roll.</p> <h4 id="-hagitoru-aori-no-jutsu---tearing-gust-technique-">–( Hagitoru Aori no Jutsu - Tearing Gust Technique )–</h4> <p>Generally performed with a fan as a matter of practicality, this technique unleashes a burst of wind that will not only deflect projectiles, but also strip them of any chakra they may be infused with.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 5</li> <li>Seal Speed: 6</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is usable as an interrupt against any ranged weapon attack. Make a parry roll (using your Ninjutsu Accuracy) with a +3 bonus; success means you deflect their attack harmlessly. If you fail, but Partial Success applies, any non-Katon ninjutsu links on it (such as Raisen) are removed.</p> <h4 id="-rakuyou-buyou---falling-leaves-dance-">–( Rakuyou Buyou - Falling Leaves Dance )–</h4> <p>Using the wind, you kick up any light debris in the area (leaves in a forest, sand in a desert, conveniently ubiquitous scraps of paper in a town) to swirl around you just long enough for you to make a sneaky, ninja-fast getaway.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Seal Speed: 6</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You Hide, with a +5 bonus.</p> <h4 id="-fuuton-nagare---wind-release-stream-">–( Fuuton Nagare - Wind Release Stream )–</h4> <p>By blowing air from your mouth, you can change direction in mid-air. This allows you to control where you land when falling (avoiding the sharp rocks when you jump off a waterfall, that kind of thing) and may be useful for avoiding mid-air hazards.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 8</li> <li>Speed: 2</li> <li>Seal Speed: 6</li> </ul> <p>Effects: As described, you can control your direction in mid air. This can also be used as an interrupt when falling from any height, to slow yourself sufficiently to avoid being harmed by the impact from hitting the ground.</p> <h4 id="-taikyaku-haretsu---bursting-retreat-">–( Taikyaku Haretsu - Bursting Retreat )–</h4> <p>You take in a deep breath, then exhale a mixture of air and chakra with enough speed and force to augment a backwards leap, allowing you to hastily escape… well, whatever manner of unpleasantness you felt the need to get away from.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 7 + X</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique is used alongside a Dodge interrupt, allowing you to move a number of yards equal to a X speed move action. Additionally, if you are using this technique against an Area of Effect, the penalty to Dodge for not being able to reach the Area’s edge is reduced by X*2.</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-kamaitachi-no-jutsu---sickle-wind-technique-">–( Kamaitachi no Jutsu - Sickle Wind Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique allows you to create and manipulate many small air currents and vacuum pockets in the form of a whirling gale, which is directed at an opponent before it dissipates. This produces injuries that resemble what one would expect to see from dozens of blades.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18</li> <li>Damage: 4d8 * 5</li> <li>Range: 16</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 11</li> <li>Tags: Slashing, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique’s damage is considered 50% higher for the purpose of causing wounds.</p> <h4 id="-shinkuuha---vacuum-wave-">–( Shinkuuha - Vacuum Wave )–</h4> <p>The user takes in a deep breath an spins while exhaling, forming several rotating blades of wind that cover a substantial area around them, slicing through multiple foes at once while leaving allies unharmed</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 21</li> <li>Damage: 4d6 * 5</li> <li>Area: 20</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Projectile, Slashing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique may differentiate between enemies and allies within its area of effect, but does not penalize dodges based on its Area. It ignores armor, and its damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of Wounding.</p> <h4 id="-daitoppa---great-breakthrough-">–( Daitoppa - Great Breakthrough )–</h4> <p>A relatively simple technique which creates a sudden gust of wind. Its actual force varies wildly based upon the strength of the user. A superior shinobi will produce alarmingly destructive results, while a weaker one would be better off finding other methods to attack.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Damage: 5d4 * 5</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Status: (NDB * 3) Knockback</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This uses double the user’s normal ninjutsu damage bonus for its damage.</p> <h4 id="-reppuushou---violent-wind-palm-">–( Reppuushou - Violent Wind Palm )–</h4> <p>After finishing the seals, the user claps their palms together and compresses the air in front of them, transforming it into a powerful gale with enough force to knock over a human or redirect projectile weapons.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 14</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Tags: Slashing, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can be used as an attack, as an interrupt, or in combination with a multi-throw. As an attack, it does 2d6 * 5 damage and if you hit, you make an opposed roll of your Chakra Control vs your target’s Athletics; if they fail, they’re knocked prone, and receive +3 to their Resistance rolls to avoid being tripped by this technique for the remainder of the battle.</p> <p>As an interrupt, it can be used in response to a thrown weapon attack, allowing you to make a ninjutsu parry roll against the attack. If you succeed, you redirect their attack at them, using its original accuracy and speed, adding 2d6 * 5 to the attack’s damage plus your interrupt’s Speed * NDB. Wounds inflicted are based off of the combined damage total, and the damage type is based on the thrown attack.</p> <p>In combination with a multi-throw, this acts as a link, making this technique Speed +8 and Seal Speed +8 (which, as a reminder, does not have the Speed or Seal speed adding to damage, as is normal for links). The attack uses the combined range of the thrown weapons and this technique to determine its maximum range, and adds 2d6 * 5 to its damage. Wounds inflicted are based off of the combined damage total, and the damage type is based on the thrown attack.</p> <h4 id="-kazekame-kaigara-no-jutsu---wind-turtles-shell-technique-">–( Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu - Wind Turtle’s Shell Technique )–</h4> <p>The technique creates a rotating dome of wind around the user, chakra-infused air moving quickly enough to blur the image of the person inside, and deflect many incoming attacks. However, the technique is a far cry from being a true absolute defense.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 14</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may be used against Ninjutsu attacks with the ‘Projectile’ tag and Ranged Taijutsu attacks. If used against a technique of C-rank or below (including basic attacks and Multi-throws), its Chakra cost is 14. Each rank above C increases Wind Turtle Shell’s Chakra cost by 6. Make a ninjutsu parry roll against the attack. If you succeed, the attack is avoided as if you parried it.</p> <p>Against Raiton and Ranged Taijutsu, you receive a bonus to your Accuracy equal to your NDB or this technique’s final Speed, whichever is lower. Against non-Katon Projectile ninjutsu, your bonus is instead +4. For Katon ninjutsu, you receive no bonus.</p> <p>This has improved effectiveness against Raiton and Ranged Taijutsu: Even if you fail, the effect of partial success is doubled (the attack deals only 10% damage per point it hits by). However, it is vulnerable to Katon: If you fail the roll against a Katon attack, you receive no benefit from partial success, and the technique has its damage (against you) increased by 15%.</p> <h4 id="-tobu-choyaku-no-jutsu---vaulting-leap-technique-">–( Tobu Choyaku no Jutsu - Vaulting Leap Technique )–</h4> <p>After performing the seals for this jutsu you amass chakra in your feet, then expel it to generate a powerful burst of wind while kicking off the ground with a power leap. To the inexperienced, the results look almost like flight.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 14 + X/2</li> <li>Stamina: 0 + 10 * Y</li> <li>Speed: 10 + X * 2, Delay X * 2</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When you activate this technique you can jump (STR/10 - Y * 2) * (ninjutsu damage bonus) yards vertically, or half that distance horizontally, and go half the distance of the choice you didn’t pick: Thus, if you jumped 50 yards vertically, you would also move 25 yards horizontally. Alternatively, you could jump (50/2) = 25 yards horizontally, reaching a vertical height of 12 yards vertically to do so.</p> <p>Additionally, you may choose to ‘charge’ your jump, gathering enough chakra at your feet to launch yourself a prodigious distance: This changes the distance moved to (X + STR /10 - Y * 2) * (ninjutsu damage bonus). If X is 5 or greater, the horizontal leap distance is not halved. X has a maximum value of 10.</p> <p>If you are suffering from an Immobilization penalty, the distance you’re able to travel with Vaulting Leap is reduced by 5% per point of Immobilization. You ignore all Ground-based Environmental effects for this movement. This technique’s Y value starts at 0. Every time you use Vaulting Leap, it’s increased by 1. After you go 50 IC without using Vaulting Leap, it’s reset to 0.</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-daikamaitachi-no-jutsu---great-sickle-wind-technique-">–( Daikamaitachi no Jutsu - Great Sickle Wind Technique )–</h4> <p>The user of this technique releases a powerful burst of wind, chakra concentrating the air into several layered air streams. This creates pockets of both vacuums and high-speed air which have enough focused force behind them to cut down trees.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Damage: 6d8 * 6</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Tags: Slashing, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as an Interrupt against a ranged taijutsu attack. Make a ninjutsu accuracy roll, adding half your NDB as a bonus to your roll: If you succeed, you deflect their attack harmlessly and attack them at the same time, using the result of your roll as the Accuracy for your attack. If you hit them with this new attack, they must make a status roll: if they fail, it will also knock them back (NDB) yards and leave them prone.</p> <h4 id="-shinkuu-enzan---decapitating-vacuum-disc-">–( Shinkuu Enzan - Decapitating Vacuum Disc )–</h4> <p>As devastating as it is impractical, this technique earned its name for a reason. After forming the many, many handseals involved, you draw a shuriken (or one of its larger brethren) and use it to center a disc of wind chakra. When you throw the weapon, its rotation is passed onto the chakra, forming a several-foot-wide blade rotating at incredible speed. Great for spars and parties!</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 38</li> <li>Damage: (Weapon) +(NDB)d_</li> <li>Range: (Weapon) + (NDB * 2) yards</li> <li>Speed: (Weapon) + 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 22</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> <li>Tags: Projectile, Slashing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Choose a type of shuriken to use with this technique:you may not multi-throw with Shinkuu Enzan. Add your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together–this is your damage bonus for Shinkuu Enzan. For calculating wounds, consider Shinkuu Enzan’s damage to be 100% higher. Although this technique uses a thrown weapon as part of it, it is a Fuuton ninjutsu technique, not a thrown weapon technique; Weapon Focus, other weapon abilities, and weapon qualities (such as a Fuuma Shuriken’s increased damage based on how much it hits by) do not apply to Shinkuu Enzan, nor do defenses specifically targeting thrown weapons.</p> <h4 id="-shinkuugyoku---vacuum-sphere-">–( Shinkuugyoku - Vacuum Sphere )–</h4> <p>The user exhales their breath as several small blasts of wind chakra, each not much larger than a marble but traveling at extreme speeds and possessing incredible penetrating power. Their small size can make them difficult to land a strong blow with, which is compensated for by dispersing them over a significant area.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Damage: 8d8 * 8</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Area: Special</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Piercing, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Shinkuugyoku targets everything in a line 20 yards wide, between you and its maximum range. You may divide the width by any whole number between 1 and 5 to multiply the length by half that much. (For example, you could reduce it to 20/5 = 4 yards wide, and increase its range to 40 * 2.5 = 100). The Improved Area ability provides only half its normal benefit to Shinkuugyoku, and both it and Improved Range are applied before you choose to modify (divide) its width. Partial Success is doubled against this technique: for every point it hits by, it deals only 10% of its full damage. However, to determine wounds inflicted Shinkuugyoku’s damage is 100% higher. If someone Takes the Hit for Shinkuugyoku, whoever they were defending will still take 75% damage, so long as the defender received a Major or greater wound.</p> <h4 id="-shinkuu-renpa---vacuum-serial-waves-">–( Shinkuu Renpa - Vacuum Serial Waves )–</h4> <p>This technique’s user takes a deep breath in, and then exhales several blades of high-speed, chakra-infused wind at varying angles. This technique’s power can vary greatly depending on the amount of chakra put into the formation of those wind blades, the number created, and how the user chooses to focus them.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20 + 5 * X</li> <li>Damage: (X * 2)d10 * 7</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Speed: 22</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12 + X * 2</li> <li>Tags: Projectile, Slashing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: X may not exceed 5. You may target up to X people with Shinkuu Renpa as a single action. While the base damage remains the same no matter how many targets you have, your (ninjutsu damage bonus) * (Shinkuu Renpa’s Speed) is divided by the number of targets. Against ninjutsu-based defenses, Shinkuu Renpa is considered one rank higher, or to deal twice as much damage, as applicable. (For example, a 200 damage Shinkuu Renpa against a 100 damage wall would destroy the wall and still deal 150 damage to whatever was behind it).</p> <h4 id="-fuujin-kokyuu---wind-gods-breath-">–( Fuujin Kokyuu - Wind God’s Breath )–</h4> <p>You unleash a wave of chakra converted into gale-force winds, knocking away everyone and everything around you. So long as the winds remain, approaching you is exceedingly difficult. At the same time, those winds will whip any nearby fires into a raging fury.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 26</li> <li>Upkeep: 6</li> <li>Area: 30</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Every IC, everyone in the technique’s radius is pushed 1 yard away from you, towards its edge. Effects which reduce knockbacks do not prevent this movement, though any effect which anchors someone to a point will, as does any external Immobility penalty someone is suffering from, reducing their movement by 0.1 per severity (meaning that, at Immobility 2, you would be pushed bac 0.8 yards per IC: 0.8 after one IC, 1.6 after two IC, etc).</p> <p>All Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks within or passing through this area have their damage reduced by 20%. Fuuton you use against those within the area have +3 Accuracy, though you deal 15% less damage with Katon, and Katon used against you have their damage increased by 15%.</p> <p>You can not Hide, or be hidden, while maintaining this technique’s Upkeep.</p> <h4 id="-ama-no-yachimata---crossroads-of-heaven-">–( Ama no Yachimata - Crossroads of Heaven )–</h4> <p>One of the more reliable defensive measure Fuuton users are capable of deploying, this creates a sphere of whipping winds around them. Aside from dramatically tossing their hair, causing loose clothes to flap about, and knocking up loose terrain, this makes a sufficiently skilled user virtually impervious to most long-range assaults.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Upkeep: 5</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Tags: Point Blank Area of Effect, Environmental, Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Any ranged taijutsu and Raiton attacks against you with Accuracy less than (your Accuracy +5) are automatically parried, as are any Projectile Ninjutsu techniques with an Accuracy less than your Accuracy. You can not be grappled while this technique is active, and any grapples you were in immediately end.</p> <p>This technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Fuuton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though offensive roll penalties from Fatigue do apply. Because it is considered to be the technique parrying incoming attacks, and not you, you cannot modify its accuracy further (such as with Willpower or AP). This technique does not offer any sort of Partial Success; it either deflects an attack fully or it does not. For the case of Fatigue penalties, it uses any penalty based on your Fatigue level for Accuracy, rather than the penalty to defensive rolls.</p> <h4 id="-higashikaze-no-me---eye-of-the-east-wind-">–( Higashikaze no Me - Eye of the East Wind )–</h4> <p>An advanced surveillance technique that, ultimately, falls far short of the efficacy its designers had hoped for. Once activated, it allows the users to view air currents, and, for lack of a better term, ‘highlights’ inconsistent ones–it’s something like visual sonar. The idea behind the technique was that this would let its user pinpoint enemies by being able to find their breathing. It’s not nearly that effective in practice, but does offer some benefits to those willing to adjust to the altered vision it causes.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 24</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When performing a Search (in Combat -&gt; Stealth) or Observe (Ninjutsu -&gt; Bunshin) action, you may use your Chakra Control skill ranks in place of your Awareness skill ranks, and receive a bonus of (ninjutsu damage bonus)/3 either way.</p> <p>When targetted by a Surprise or Sneak Attack, you are allowed an Awareness roll (with this technique’s effects) opposed by a Stealth roll from your attacker; if you beat their roll, you can choose to negate the effect of it being a Surprise or Sneak Attack (against you only), or to spot their location, causing them to no longer be hidden from you after the attack (in the event the attack itself does not remove them from Stealth).</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-rank</h2> <h4 id="-kaze-no-yaiba---blade-of-wind-">–( Kaze no Yaiba - Blade of Wind )–</h4> <p>A rarely-used technique, not because it isn’t powerful but because it doesn’t appeal to the sorts of shinobi able to learn it. It’s a high-powered, taxing, close-ranged wind release technique; most shinobi who prefer close combat will opt for weapons or other elements, and most wind release users prefer to keep their distance. It has seen some limited popular of Sunagakure’s ANBU. The user emits chakra from their fingertips, forming a virtually invisible “sword” of intense, high-speed winds, which lasts just long enough to make a single attack with. This technique leaves very distinctive wounds, deep slashes with hundreds of miniscule tears at the edges.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 35</li> <li>Upkeep: 0</li> <li>Damage: 5d8 * 10</li> <li>Accuracy: +5</li> <li>Range: Melee</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan</li> <li>Tags: Melee, Slashing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique cannot be blocked, and the effectiveness of an opponent’s damage reduction is halved.</p> <p>After you first use this technique, you may use it consecutively (using no other non-interrupt jutsu between uses), which removes its Seal Speed and reduces its Chakra Cost by 10 (to 25). However, after each attack you make with it (including the first), its Upkeep increases by 3. Once you release the upkeep, the blade dissipates and you must use this technique again (at its normal cost) to reform it. This technique has its damage increased by 50% for Wounding.</p> <h4 id="-renkuudan---compressed-air-blast-">–( Renkuudan - Compressed Air Blast )–</h4> <p>A technique originated in Sand, supposedly derived from what was alleged to be a power wielded by a ‘monster’ that terrorized that country more than a century and a half ago. The user draws in a deep breath and begins pouring chakra into the air in their lungs, thickening it until it reaches an almost-liquid consistency before ejecting it into a high-power blast of air.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 35 + X / 5</li> <li>Damage: (2 + X / 2)d12 * 5</li> <li>Accuracy: + X / 5</li> <li>Range: 30 + X</li> <li>Speed: 10 + X, Delay X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 25</li> <li>Tags: Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: After completing this technique’s seals you may use it immediately (as Speed 10, and Delay 0), or begin ‘charging’ it. X is the number of IC spent charging Renkuudan.</p> <p>You do not need to declare how long you intend to do this. For example, say you finished the handseals on IC 100. You would then be able to declare you were charging Renkuudan, without specifying when you intended to stop. On IC 120, an enemy might begin running towards you; at this point you could stop charging and fire your technique, with X = 20. X can never exceed 50. The severity of wounds for Renkuudan are reduced by one category (major to minor, minor to no wound, and so on). Renkuudan uses double your normal ninjutsu damage bonus for its damage.</p> <h4 id="-okamaitachi-no-jutsu---scything-wind-technique-">–( Okamaitachi no Jutsu - Scything Wind Technique )–</h4> <p>Almost always used with a fan, this technique creates a vast number of heavy air currents and vacuum pockets, varying greatly in speed, width, and angle, with their integrity maintained by chakra. Where they intersect, the crossing currents tear apart anything unfortunate enough to be in their way. As effective as this technique is, slicing and smashing anything short of fortified stonework, it can be somewhat unreliable, as there’s an element of chance about just how many different ways a victim will be shredded.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Damage: 4d10 * 10</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Speed: 24</li> <li>Seal Speed: 28</li> <li>Tags: Targeted Area of Effect, Projectile, Slashing</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may target any number of people in front of you, so long as they are all within range, and for the purposes of evading is considered to have an Area equal to its Range. Scything Wind’s damage is considered 25% higher for the purposes of inflicting wounds, and its damage can not be blocked.</p> <h4 id="-shinkuu-taigyoku---vacuum-great-sphere-">–( Shinkuu Taigyoku - Vacuum Great Sphere )–</h4> <p>If the Vacuum Sphere technique can be considered a spray of wind-chakra bullets (not that ninja actually know what such things are!), then the Great Vacuum Sphere is a gigantic wind-chakra cannon ball. In terms that ninja actually do understand, this creates a large sphere-shaped vacuum, which is then launched forwards. Anyone who comes in contact with the vacuum is sucked inside, and then either slammed against either the first solid object it encounters or just hit by what amounts to a wall of high-velocity air from every direction as the chakra in the technique dissipates and the technique collapses on them.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 38</li> <li>Damage: 5d6 * 10</li> <li>Accuracy: +3</li> <li>Range: 30</li> <li>Area: 20</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 28</li> <li>Status: Stun 15, (Range) Knockback</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Blunt, Projectile</li> </ul> <p>Effects: In addition to targeting anyone in its area, anyone between the user and its eventual destination is also a target. Shinkuu Taigyoku is unblockable. Anyone hit is knocked back to the far end of its range. The severity of any wounds Shinkuu Taigyoku inflicts is increased by one category (minor to major, severe to critical, and so forth).</p> <h4 id="-taifuu-no-me---eye-of-the-storm-">–( Taifuu no Me - Eye of the Storm )–</h4> <p>A powerful wind technique, this emanates an incredibly powerful wind, starting about a foot away from you and pushing away in all directions. Though not directly harmful itself, it’s incredibly difficult to fight through, and will only grow more so as each wind jutsu you perform strengthens the storm.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 34</li> <li>Upkeep: 6 + (X)/100</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When first activated, the tornado pushes everyone away from you, causing any grapples you were a part of to automatically end and everyone within (NDB) yards of you must make a status roll to resist being knocked back (CHA/10) yards.</p> <p>The tornado provides a Damage Reduction of (your ninjutsu damage bonus) * 10. Any time you use a damage-dealing Fuuton jutsu, this DR is increased by (your ninjutsu damage bonus) * (Rank - 1), with E being 0, D being 1, etc. This DR doesn’t apply to Katon, and is considered 50% higher against Raiton. Non-projectile ranged attacks (such as Retsudotensho) only have their damage reduced by half the normal amount. X is the current amount of DR this technique is granting you–its Upkeep steadily increases as its power does.</p> <p>Additionally, the surge of wind each time this tornado is empowered pushes enemies (along with anyone and everything else) away from you. Anyone within (your ninjutsu damage bonus) yards is knocked back (1 per rank of the jutsu; 1 for E, 5 for A, etc.) * (your ninjutsu damage bonus)/3 yards, if they fail a status roll.</p> <p>Its primary downside, however, is the difficulty in dragging a raging tornado along: so long as it’s maintained, the user’s movement speed is reduced by 40%, +10% more for every 100 DR. When the reduction reaches 100% (at 600 DR), you can no longer move at all, effectively stuck in place. However, so long as this technique’s maintained, it’s impossible to grapple you.</p> <p>You may choose to end it at will, or when making any damage-dealing Fuuton attack (whose Chakra Exhaustion roll will still be penalized by Taifuu no Me’s upkeep), adding your total amassed damage reduction to that technique’s damage.</p> <h4 id="-fuuton-kitakaze---wind-release-the-north-wind-">–( Fuuton: Kitakaze - Wind Release: The North Wind )–</h4> <p>The north wind wind cleanses the world of its impurities and soothes the raging elements. Once its handseals are completed, a calm but strong wind blows in from the north.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Speed: 22</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: All environmental effects caused by Ninjutsu (such as Yomi Numa, or Four Pillar Bind) end immediately, and no such techniques may be activated for (NDB * 2) IC; hoever, this does not end or prevent B- or A-Rank Katon.</p> <p>Any Ignite status effects have their severity halved (round down), and any Immobility penalties with set durations (meaning, ones that fade by a certain amount every so-many IC) are removed, as is any Paralysis or Shock that was originally caused by a Raiton technique (including Shock from Elemental Mastery).</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
