These are nothing but weak constructs of chakra, and cannot interact with the world around them–though they can speak.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5 + 3 per clone</li> <li>Speed: 6 + 1 per clone</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4 + 1 per clone</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You may create up to 3 clones. During this process you can ‘hide’ among your clones, making it impossible to tell which one is the fake. Any targeting you must roll 1d(1 + number of clones). On a roll of 1, it targets you; on anything else, it aims at a clone; clones cannot dodge, parry, or use jutsu. A clone that’s been hit or takes any damage is destroyed; if you’re hit, your clones remain but are mostly useless (as you’ve been identified by your opponents). If you make new clones (of the same type, or a different variety), all your pre-existing ones are immediately destroyed.</p> <p>Several other actions related to this jutsu are significant:</p> <h6 id="hide-among-clones">Hide Among Clones</h6> <p><em>(Speed 4, or Speed +6)</em><br> You pull off a quick shell-game maneuver, confusing your opponents. If they’ve singled you out from your clones, and you’re free to maneuver, you may do this to hide yourself. You roll Stealth against their Awareness skill; success means you’ve once again concealed yourself. Doing this alone is a Speed 4 action, but it may also be used with another action (such as an attack) by increasing that action’s Speed by 6.</p> <h6 id="observe">Observe</h6> <p><em>(Speed 4)</em><br> Anyone can try to observe you and your clones to try and find a discrepancy, such as the clones not casting shadows or not leaving footprints behind. This allows them to make an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control; if they succeed, they can tell you apart from all your clones, and recognize those clones as such, until you hide among them again.</p> <h4 id="-henge-no-jutsu---transformation-technique-">–( Henge no Jutsu - Transformation Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique is as common as it is basic, yet to the ordinary civilian it’s one of the most mysterious and feared capabilities ninja possess: the power to take the shape of another person. With this jutsu a ninja can alter their appearance to match that of another person or object. If used to transform into anything but another human, it only lets you take on the thing’s shape and basic physical characteristics: turning into a rock wouldn’t make you nearly invulnerable, turning into a bird would not let you fly, and while you could transform into a particularly large shuriken your ‘edges’ would be too dull to cut with–in the last case, however, you would be fairly aerodynamic.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Upkeep: 0</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You look like another person. At a glance, this is nearly flawless. Of course, the technique has many weaknesses: if you don’t know about, say, a birthmark, then your Henge wouldn’t reproduce it. If someone interacts with you and knows the person you’re trying to imitate, they have an opposed Espionage roll (with a +5 bonus; +10 if it’s someone they know exceptionally well, such as a sibling or loved one) against yours to see through the Henge. Beyond just that roll, there are ways a Henge can automatically be seen through–not knowing a password, or saying something the person you’re trying to imitate would never say. On the other hand, you could just Henge into someone other than yourself. If you try to turn into some piece of scenery, any ninja who come within 10 yards of you have a chance to notice the deception; you have an Espionage roll with a +10 bonus against their Awareness to remain concealed. Any time you take damage, your Henge effect ends immediately; it’s just an inherent flaw in the technique.</p> <h4 id="-kawarimi-no-jutsu---substitution-technique-">–( Kawarimi no Jutsu - Substitution Technique )–</h4> <p>The final of the three basic ninja techniques–along with Bunshin and Henge–is the substitution technique, allowing a ninja to move so quickly they cannot be seen by the naked eye and replace themselves with a wooden log (don’t ask where the wooden logs come from) or other harmless object.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: +4</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique is activated after you have failed to dodge an attack, but the damage would be reduced by partial defense. In the case of non-damaging techniques, this can be used whenever it hits by 5 points or less. As long as the dodge’s new Speed (including the +4 from Substitution, and its Seal Speed) would still be valid for interrupting (you may spend AP to reduce Kawarimi’s Speed, as usual, but may not reduce the original dodge’s speed at this point), you can pay 5 AP to fully dodge that attack.</p> <p>Each time you use Kawarimi, its AP cost is increased by 5 for the rest of that battle. The second time you used Kawarimi would cost 10 AP, the third would cost 15 AP, and so forth. If Kawarimi’s Seal Speed is reduced to 0, you can perform it without handseals. After successful use of Kawarimi, you may immediately attempt to Hide. Used this way, your opponent is allowed an immediate Awareness roll against your Stealth TN (though this does not apply to the cumulative bonus they would get for searching for you).</p> <h4 id="-ninshiki-kaado---ninja-info-cards-">–( Ninshiki Kaado - Ninja Info Cards )–</h4> <p>This jutsu uses specially prepared cards capable of being encoded with chakra. Although the cards appear blank, anyone familiar with this technique will be able to identify them. The cards themselves are a trivial purchase (no cost or equipment entry associated with them). When chakra is applied to them (via use of this jutsu) they can be encoded with hidden information. This information can be retrieved the same way, but only by the person who stored the information to begin with.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> <li>Seal Speed: 7</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Performing this technique requires a surface to rest the cards on as they are encoded, one at a time, with chakra. Essentially any kind of information (images, graphs, maps, text) can be placed on the cards, though their size is a limiting factor. Since these can not be used to pass messages, they’re typically used for more mundane uses, like holding ones shopping list.</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-rank</h2> <h4 id="-genjutsu-kai---genjutsu-release-">–( Genjutsu Kai - Genjutsu Release )–</h4> <p>The most common and perhaps most effective method of combatting genjutsu, if one ends up caught up in one and aware enough to realize it. Kai involves temporarily stopping the flow of chakra throughout the body, and then sending a burst to the brain in an attempt to force the attacker’s chakra from their body.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10 + X</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 5</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This can be done on yourself, or another willing person. You must be able to touch the other person when performing the jutsu. This allows the person it’s used on to make another roll against a Genjutsu affecting them, with a bonus of X. X has a limit of (5+XP/300). This may also be done against Area of Effect genjutsu, in which case this technique’s user makes a genjutsu roll against the original roll made by whoever put the technique in place. If successful, the technique is dispelled in its entirety.</p> <h4 id="-shunshin-no-jutsu---body-flicker-technique-">–( Shunshin no Jutsu - Body Flicker Technique )–</h4> <p>A high-speed movement technique which allows the user to travel incredibly distances in the blink of eye; used by a sufficiently powerful ninja, this can be mistaken for teleportation by an untrained observer.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Speed: 2</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You move as far as you could in a Speed X move action, where X is how many AP you choose to spend on this technique. There is no limit on how many AP you may spend. You may use this in place of normal movement to help dodge an Area of Effect technique. Use your AP spent, rather than the Speed of the attack and your normal movement speed, to determine how close to the edge of the effect you can get. This increases the Speed of your dodge by 2.</p> <h4 id="-kanashibari-no-jutsu---temporary-paralysis-technique-">–( Kanashibari no Jutsu - Temporary Paralysis Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique temporarily restrains the victim with chakra by disrupting their chakra flow throughout the body, causing temporary spasms that inhibit normal function. Used effectively, it can temporarily debilitate a target for a short period of time.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Status: Immobilize 2 + Special</li> <li>Tags: Internal</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If your target fails a status roll, they’re inflicted with an Immobilize 2, +1 for every 4 you beat their roll by, to a maximum of of Immobilize 6; every time after the first someone has to roll against this technique’s effects in the same battle, they gain +5 to their roll.</p> <h4 id="-utsusemi-no-jutsu---cicada-shell-technique-">–( Utsusemi no Jutsu - Cicada Shell Technique )–</h4> <p>One of the oldest, most iconic techniques possessed by ninjas, in the eyes of civilians. It’s very useful for the ninja who are concerned with acting “ninja-like”, as it allows a shinobi to project their voice over an area while concealing their presence. This means that a shinobi can talk to someone without giving away their location, and can also be very unnerving. This isn’t a megaphone, and it doesn’t let you broadcast your voice over entire towns. Your voice won’t carry any farther than it normally would, but it seems to be coming from all around.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Upkeep: 0</li> <li>Speed: 2</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: As described above, you can speak freely while hidden without giving people any indication of where you might be hiding. Activating Utsusemi while in hiding does not break stealth (unlike normal ninjutsu).</p> <h4 id="-haruka-bakuhatsu-no-jutsu---remote-detonation-technique-">–( Haruka Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Remote Detonation Technique )–</h4> <p>Explosives are useful; and, more importantly, who doesn’t love explosions? However, needing to be at ground zero of an impending explosion to set tags off is something which many shinobi, understandably, have reservations about, and severely diminishes the potential tactical uses. Hence, this technique! It allows a shinobi to detonate multiple exploding tags from a distance–not as great a distance as most would like, or as many as most shinobi would prefer, but it’s better than doing it the old-fashioned way.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10 + X * 3</li> <li>Range: 15 + CHA/10 yards</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4 + X * 2</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You detonate up to (Chakra Control ranks)/5 exploding tags within this technique’s range. This only works on tags which you have primed. X is the number of tags you detonate, which have their normal delay you declare when you use this technique, as described in Exploding Tags (in Equipment).</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-sanzengarasu-no-jutsu---scattering-one-thousand-crows-technique-">–( Sanzengarasu no Jutsu - Scattering One Thousand Crows Technique )–</h4> <p>This summons a flock of chakra-created and -guided crows which surround and disorient them. The crows continuously multiply and clone themselves, and will soon surround the target entirely.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 14 + X</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 13</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If the target fails a status roll, this inflicts a -1 visibility penalty upon them, which increases every 10 IC until reaching -X; X has a maximum of 10. (Chakra Control ranks) IC after that, it dissipates entirely. The application of an Area of Effect attack will destroy the crows, if it actually hits this technique’s victim.</p> <h4 id="-chakra-strengthening-">–( Chakra Strengthening )–</h4> <p>A fairly simple, yet often impractically demanding technique. The user channels chakra into their limbs, increasing their speed and strength. Despite being very good at what it does, it rapidly takes a toll on one’s energy reserves.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15 + 3 * X</li> <li>Upkeep: 2 * X</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You have a +X bonus to your physical damage bonus and dodge while you maintain Chakra Strengthening. X has a maximum of 5.</p> <h4 id="-soushuujin---manipulating-attack-blades-">–( Soushuujin - Manipulating Attack Blades )–</h4> <p>This technique allows the user to briefly levitate multiple kunai in mid-air using chakra, and then direct them at an opponent, more quickly than if each was being thrown individually. Even more impressively, it allows you to reuse the weapons you maintain control over, preventing you from having to pick them back up (or giving your opponent a chance to do so).</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10 + X</li> <li>Upkeep: X / 3 (rounded up)</li> <li>Range: 5 + CHA/4</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can control up to X Kunai at once, to a maximum of CHA/10, and ‘throw’ them using your Chakra, following standard multithrow rules, except that you replace the normal Stamina cost with an equivalent Chakra cost. It uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus in place of your Physical Damage Bonus, but gains only +0.25 per weapon thrown instead of the normal +0.5. Because this technique allows you manipulate the Kunai in mid air and alter their trajectory, anyone attempting to parry your multithrows with this technique takes a -X/3 penalty to their Parry roll, rounded down. The Kunai fall wherever they were hovering when you stop maintaining this technique’s Upkeep, but so long as you maintain the Upkeep, your Kunai can not be ‘retrieved’ by anyone else. Effects which state they ruin the weapons used (such as Housenka), however, will end this technique automatically (as you must reuse it to apply it to new weapons). Uniques and effects which modify how many weapons you can throw, or how far you can throw them, will affect this technique’s limitations and range normally, but the abilities Improved Range and Quick Hands do not.</p> <h4 id="-kuchiyose-no-jutsu---summoning-technique-">–( Kuchiyose no Jutsu - Summoning Technique )–</h4> <p>One of the simplest techniques in the esoteric discipline of space-time ninjutsu, the summoning technique allows a ninja- -the summoner–to transport creatures over great distances instantly. Most of these summons take the form of giant, intelligent animals.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: Varies</li> <li>Speed: Varies</li> <li>Seal Speed: Varies</li> <li>Requires: Summoning Contract</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Even if you know this technique, you may not summon anything until you have a contract with it. These are supernatural contracts with, as mentioned above, supernatural animals. What you can summon, and what it does, depends on the nature of the contract. These contracts are often known as “blood contracts”, both because they’re signed in blood, and because performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu requires an offering of the user’s blood. It’s not very much; a few drops will suffice, as long as it’s fresh. Some ninja will make a small cut on their arm or palm, though dedicated summoners prefer the rather unsightly expedient of biting themselves, often on the pad or back of their thumb, hard enough to draw blood–summoning-focused shinobi can sometimes be identified by the small, deep scars in those locations. If you have a summoning contract (usually obtained from the Summoning Contract talent) you can learn Kuchiyose no Jutsu without meeting the normal requirements to learn Crank ninjutsu.</p> <h4 id="-kikkake-bakuhatsu-no-jutsu---triggered-detonation-technique-">–( Kikkake Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Triggered Detonation Technique )–</h4> <p>Explosives are, to say the least, useful. Unfortunately, their utility as traps is severely limited by the fact that, normally, someone must be nearby watching over them to have them explode when necessary. This technique allows tags to be set to detonate in advance, which both makes them viable as traps and allows the shinobi who placed them to attend to other matters.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15 + X * 5</li> <li>Speed: 20 + X * 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You place X tags up to a maximum of (Chakra Control ranks)/5. One or more (up to ‘all’) of these tags may be designated as ‘triggers’. When performing this technique specify a range between 0 and (Chakra Control ranks)/5 yards, and a time between 10 IC and 10 + (Chakra Control ranks) IC. Whenever someone comes in that many yards of a trigger tag, all the other tags it is linked with (by that usage of Triggered Detonation) will detonate that many IC later. Tags placed with this technique may not be set off via Remote Detonation, nor may they be part of more than one ‘set’ of Triggered Detonation tags. All tags linked by a single usage of Triggered Detonation must be within (Chakra Control ranks) yards of each other.</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-shoushagan-no-jutsu---vanishing-facial-copy-technique-">–( Shoushagan no Jutsu - Vanishing Facial Copy Technique )–</h4> <p>Developed for spying and infiltration, this technique is highly effective, but grisly enough that most shinobi will deign not to even learn how to perform it, regardless of its efficacy. With this technique, you steal the face off of a corpse and make it your own.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You physically remove the face from a corpse and place it on top of yours. The body in question must be recently deceased (within the past 24 hours) and not grievously mutilated (no Severe or higher Head wounds). Your voice and skin tone will change to match that of the person whose face you stole, but your height, build, and gender will not. The face merges with your own seamlessly. Unlike henge, use of this technique is completely undetectable by doujutsu and similar chakra-viewing effects. This can be maintained indefinitely, but a Major or worse Head wound of any sort will cause the stolen face to tear, revealing (part of) your own beneath it. Aside from being a fairly disturbing sight, this sort of ruins the subterfuge aspects of the technique. At that point, your face and skin tone return to normal. You may peel off and discard the face at will, ending this jutsu whenever you please. A discarded face cannot be reused. Learning this technique causes you to have a one-time increase of +10 Infamy.</p> <h4 id="-senri-bakuhatsu-no-jutsu---long-range-detonation-technique-">–( Senri Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Long-Range Detonation Technique )–</h4> <p>An improvement to the more basic remote detonation technique. As ninja become more powerful, they inevitably find themselves needing bigger explosions, and by extension, the ability to not get caught in their own explosions.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10 + X * 5</li> <li>Range: 15 + CHA/2</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 6 + X * 3</li> <li>Requires: Remote Detonation Technique</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You detonate up to (Chakra Control skill rank)/5 exploding tags within this technique’s range, with X being the number of tags you detonate. In all other regards, it functions identically to the D-rank Remote Detonation Technique.</p> <h4 id="-kekkai-houjin---barrier-encampment-method-">–( Kekkai Houjin - Barrier Encampment Method )–</h4> <p>One of the most tried-and-true methods of setting traps using explosives, this puts an array of four explosive tags around the boundary of an area. If anyone tries to pass through the area the tags will detonate, spelling misfortune for the target. Rumors of this technique “misfiring” and eradicating deer and bears are largely fabricated. Humans and summon animals will trigger it, but not ordinary fauna.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 25</li> <li>Range: Special</li> <li>Requires: Triggered Detonation</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique cannot be used in combat, as it takes a few minutes to set up appropriately. You place four exploding tags at the corner of a square or rectangle, facing inwards; they can be hidden if you have the Tag Concealment ability. Each side of the square they form can be up to double the Area of the tags you’re using in length. When someone moves to leave the area (meaning if they travel in any direction from the center, or get part way in and then turn around), the tags will detonate 10 IC later. Anyone who hasn’t escaped the area (or otherwise defended themselves) by then will take the combined damage of three exploding tags, regardless of their location within the boundary. Notably, anyone outside the ‘barrier’ is unharmed; part of this technique is that it directs all the explosive force inwards. Directional defenses (such as Earth Shore Return) are insufficient to protect against this, as the explosion originates from multiple directions.</p> <h4 id="-dokugiri---poison-mist-">–( Dokugiri - Poison Mist )–</h4> <p>One of the most disproportionately difficult techniques to master, this technique requires its user to have advanced knowledge of chemistry, poisons, and medicine. On top of that, it requires exceedingly precise chakra control. The user gathers chakra in their lungs and molds it into a highly toxic chemical substance, which they then exhale through their mouth, at which point it forms a large, purplish cloud.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Area: 20</li> <li>Speed: 24</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Requires: 25 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, 25 Research, 25 Toxicology</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When you create the mist, roll the second highest of your Chakra Control, Medicine, Research, or Toxicology skill rolls (all of those factor into creating the poison properly, and a deficiency in any of them will weaken it). This is the TN to avoid being poisoned while in the cloud. Anyone inside the mist when it’s created, or who passes through it, must make a Resistance roll against that number, and another one every 10 IC that they spend inside the cloud, as well as one any time they make a Stamina roll inside it.</p> <p>The cloud is a poison with the following effects:</p> <ul> <li>Poison: (Toxicology)/5</li> <li>Paralysis: (Medicine)/6</li> <li>Shock: (Medicine)/6</li> <li>Suffocation: (Research)/10, applied every 20 IC</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the cloud itself has a (Chakra Control)/5 visibility penalty throughout its entire area.</p> <p>The duration of this poison (how long it will last once somebody’s exited the cloud) is the sum of your ranks in all those skills. The cloud itself will last twice that long, after which point it will harmlessly dissipate. You are not immune to your own poison mist.</p> <h4 id="-hari-jizou---needle-jizo-">–( Hari Jizou - Needle Jizo )–</h4> <p>By directing chakra into their hair, the shinobi causes it to grow rapidly. This results in their hair not only getting longer, but also growing in volume and hardening into what amounts to a forest of sharp, needle-thin and iron-hard spikes. Even the best-groomed hair becomes wild and spiky under the effects of this technique! This can be used for a number of derivative techniques, and on its own provides a surprisingly strong defense, as the hair will wrap around its owner to protect them from attacks. When this technique ends, the user’s hair returns to its normal length.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15 + X * 3</li> <li>Upkeep: X</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 15</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: X has a maximum of 10. Your hair’s length increases by X feet! However, now you have a lot of bulky, chakra-strengthened hair, that gets in the way when you’re trying to do super-fast ninja battles. When dodging, or moving as part of an attack, you suffer an X/2 immobilization penalty (rounded up); in the case of moving while attacking, this applies to the distance you can move, the Accuracy of the attack itself, and anything else you may need to do until the next IC. You gain a Damage Reduction of (Ninjutsu damage bonus)* (X), which is doubled while blocking. Additionally, the damage you take is considered (2.5 * X)% lower for the purposes of determining wounds. Anyone attacking you from a distance of (X/3) yards or less will take (your ninjutsu damage bonus * speed of their attack) damage; this does not apply if X is 2 or lower. So long as X is 3 or higher, this applies to all melee attacks. As a Speed 10, Chakra 5 + Y * 5 action, you may increase X’s value by Y, up to the maximum of 10. Whenever you suffer an Ignite effect, X is reduced by half the Ignite’s severity; whenever your suffer a Slashing wound, X is reduced by 1 per level of the wound’s severity (1 for a Minor, 2 for a Major, and so on). If X is reduced to 0, this technique ends.</p> <h4 id="-hari-jigoku---needle-hell-">–( Hari Jigoku - Needle Hell )–</h4> <p>While Needle Jizo is active, the shinobi focuses more chakra into their hair. There is a telltale bristling and very obvious ‘aiming’ of their hair, before they fire of hundreds of sharpened hair-needles at nearby enemies. While these are very tiny, there are enough of them, moving fast enough, to pose a credible threat to all but the hardiest of shinobi.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Damage: 10d4 * X</li> <li>Speed: 15, Delay X</li> <li>Area: Line X yards wide, to a range of X * 5 yards</li> <li>Requires: Needle Jizo active</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: X is a value up to Needle Jizo’s current Upkeep; after using Needle Hell, Needle Jizo’s Upkeep (and other, related effects) are reduced by X. When performing Needle Hell, you multiply your ninjutsu damage bonus by the lower of (X * 2) or the technique’s Speed; thus, if you did not lower its Speed with AP, and set X = 4, you would roll damage as 10d4 * 4+(ninjutsu damage bonus * 8). When this technique’s Delay ends, anyone in the area will be automatically struck by the flying needles; raising ninjutsu based defenses ahead of time (such as Earth Shore Return or Water Encampment Wall) is explicitly allowed and automatically successful, but no defensive interrupts (such as dodging) function against this technique. In addition, any Damage Reduction a victim has is doubled against Needle Hell’s damage.</p> <h4 id="-ranjishigami-no-jutsu---art-of-the-raging-lions-mane-">–( Ranjishigami no Jutsu - Art of the Raging Lion’s Mane )–</h4> <p>Using their empowered hair, the Shinobi extends and manipulates it to grapple with and usually heavily damage their target.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Range: X*3 yards</li> <li>Requires: Needle Jizo active</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique uses the current upkeep of Needle Jizo as X. When using this technique, make an Accuracy roll which ignores immobilization penalties. If it hits, your hair grapples the target; you may then immediately use an Grapple technique of B-rank or lower that you know, with no Stamina or Chakra cost, at only half its normal Speed. So long as your hair maintains this grapple, you may continue to use it to perform grapple techniques; your hair has up to X ‘limbs’, for the purposes of determining which locks and holds you can maintain. All Grapple techniques after the first use their normal Speed, and have a Chakra cost equal to (and replacing) their normal Stamina cost. Techniques performed this way use (ninjutsu damage bonus + X) rather than your physical bonus for damage and grapple rolls, and CHA in place of STR for damage dice. If an opponent fails an Escape Grapple attempt by (20 - X) or more, they are unable to break free; Escape Grapple simply fails, with a Speed of 4 and a Stamina cost of (4 + the amount they fail by, as normal). You do not suffer any of the normal downsides from being involved in a grapple, and your opponent cannot perform grapple techniques against you. They may not shift the grapple, only break free. If you and your victim move more than this technique’s range from one another, they break free automatically. Once they do break free, your Needle Jizo ends (its X being set to 0). If you end Art of the Raging Lion’s Mane yourself, however, Needle Jizo is not ended prematurely. While using Art of the Raging Lion’s Mane you do not receive any of Needle Jizo’s normal benefits, but do suffer its normal penalties.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-toumegane-no-jutsu---telescope-technique-">–( Toumegane no Jutsu - Telescope Technique )–</h4> <p>A very advanced, and in the right hands powerful, technique this jutsu can only be performed by the most skilled of Shinobi. Utilizing an expensive crystal ball and intense concentration, the user can view locations from extremely long distances.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 500</li> <li>Upkeep: 20</li> <li>Range: (Chakra Control / 4) Miles</li> <li>Requires: Chakra Control 35, Crystal Ball (see below)</li> <li>Tags: Preparation (yeah, right)</li> </ul> <p>Effects: As a Speed 10 action you may focus the Crystal Ball’s view to any location within range and view the area through the ball. This cannot penetrate chakra shields, nor can it move its view around quickly. A speed 10 action is required to change the crystal’s viewpoint even slightly. There is another feature, which requires the user to know a person’s chakra signature intimately. This means spending time studying them while training with ninjutsu in a calm setting for at least 5 minutes (or, if you’re a chakra sensor, having sensed their chakra signature successfully before). Once a person’s chakra signature is known, this technique can be performed to focus in upon that person, following them around near flawlessly at up to double the normal range. Note, this still cannot be used to locate someone hidden behind a chakra barrier of any sort. The crystal balls used in this technique are expensive, costing 2000 Ryo. They’re also rare and typically need to be custom made; they can only be purchased with Savings, not Requisition.</p> <h4 id="-meisaigakure-no-jutsu---hiding-with-camouflage-technique-">–( Meisaigakure no Jutsu - Hiding With Camouflage Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced technique where a ninja distorts how light is reflected around their body with chakra inflections, which makes them almost invisible to most normal senses.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 5</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Tags: Preparation</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique may be used when already in Stealth; it raises you to level 3 Stealth. If you end this technique’s Upkeep, you are lowered to level 2 Stealth. If you break your Stealth for some other reason (such as moving, or attacking), then Meisaigakure also ends. Once hidden by Meisaigakure, you are effectively invisible so long as you maintain its Upkeep. You could use this in the middle of a room and then go unnoticed when a group of people entered and had a conversation–though it does not make you intangible. If an enemy has a heightened sense of smell (such as an Inuzuka’s ninken), then your Stealth TN is considered 10 points lower (as if you were only in level 2 Stealth) for the purposes of hiding from them.</p> <p>Against doujutsu, you are instead considered to be one Stealth category lower than you actually are (making you be in level 2 stealth against them if you would ordinarily be in level 3 Stealth) while you maintain this technique.</p> <h4 id="-bunshin-daibakuha---clone-great-explosion-">–( Bunshin Daibakuha - Clone Great Explosion )–</h4> <p>Fundamentally, most clones are little more than dense, mobile bundles of chakra. This technique takes advantage of that by essentially converting them into bombs, overloading them with the user’s chakra and sending them to converge on a single point before exploding.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: Special</li> <li>Range: CHA/4</li> <li>Area: 25</li> <li>Speed: 16, Delay 6 + Special</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> <li>Tags: Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: After finishing this technique’s handseals, some or all (your choice) of your clones will charge towards a specific location before exploding. Clones activated with this technique can no longer take any other actions, but nor can they be destroyed by other means, and they no longer provide the normal benefits of clones (that is, the chance that an opponent will accidentally strike them instead of you). In the case of clones capable of using jutsu, any Upkeeps they’re maintaining end immediately. The “Special” portion of the Delay is however long it would take the clones to move from your current location to the center of the explosion (the location you target with this technique). They move at full speed, though immobilization penalties (such as from the ground being turned to mud) may still slow them down. Anyone hit by the explosion is allowed a Resistance roll against your Chakra Control (including you, if you’re hit). Those who passes their roll takes only half damage, and suffers half the normal status effects (excepting the visibility penalty from water clone explosions, as it is based on the location, rather than who it hits). Like the explosions from Exploding Tags, it is not possible to defend against the detonation of this technique. Each type of clone is considered to be an elemental ninjutsu of its appropriate element (shadow clones being non-elemental). Mud, Water, and Shadow Clones inflict Blunt wounds. Rock Clones deal Slashing damage, and Lightning Clones cause Energy wounds.</p> <h6 id="mud-clones">Mud Clones</h6> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5 + 10/clone</li> <li>Damage: 10d20*1 per clone Anyone hit suffers an Immobilization penalty of 2, +2 per clone. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 10 IC.</li> </ul> <h6 id="rock-clones">Rock Clones</h6> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15 + 10/clone</li> <li>Damage: 25d20*1 per clone Anyone hit suffers a Bleed status of 3/clone, and a Stun of 6/clone.</li> </ul> <h6 id="lightning-clones">Lightning Clones</h6> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15, +10/clone</li> <li>Damage: 10d20*1d4 per clone Anyone hit suffers a Shock 4 for 20 IC if one clone was used, along with a Paralysis 4 for 20 IC if two clones were used.</li> </ul> <h6 id="water-clones">Water Clones</h6> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10 +10/clone</li> <li>Damage: 8d20+100, per clone When the clones explode, they create a cloud of mist across the area which applies a -4 visibility penalty per clone. The penalty fades by 1 every 10 IC. The water used to create the clones is not added to the battlefield after the explosion.</li> </ul> <h6 id="shadow">Shadow</h6> <ul> <li>Damage: 15d20.open(11) per clone</li> <li>Stun: 20+5/clone Performing Clone Explosion with Shadow Clones has no Chakra cost.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-shuriken-kage-bunshin-no-jutsu---shuriken-shadow-clone-technique-">–( Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu - Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique )–</h4> <p>Based on the same principle as the much-more-advanced Shadow Clone technique, this creates copies of an object rather than a shinobi: specifically, as the name suggests, ordinary shuriken. What makes this actually useful is the sheer number of shuriken that can be replicated with minimal exertion from the shinobi using it; for truly skilled ninja, it can easily reach into the hundreds.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: (Special) + X/10</li> <li>Damage: (Special)</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/4</li> <li>Area: X</li> <li>Speed: (Special)</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Tags: Targeted Area of Effect</li> </ul> <p>Effects: One shuriken must be thrown each time this jutsu is used. X additional shuriken are created in mid-flight, and vanish after this technique is resolved. X has a maximum value of your CHA. Two things must be determined: the attack’s strength, and its number of targets. You may direct up to (DEX+CHA)/12 shuriken at any single target. Its Speed and Damage are determined following the normal rules for multi-throws. Determine what a normal Stamina cost would be for a multi-throw using that many shuriken; that becomes the “Special” portion of Shuriken Shadow Clone’s Chakra cost. You may attack any number of targets that way, using up to a maximum of X+1 shuriken. This is selective, meaning you may choose to hit or ignore people as you wish within the targeted area. Area of Effect dodge penalties do apply normally, however. This is treated as a ranged taijutsu multi-throw using shuriken, and does receive the normal +2 Accuracy from shuriken. No matter how many people are targeted, this is treated as a single attack, with one Accuracy and one damage roll. Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique cannot be used with poisoned weapons.</p> <h4 id="-nunoshibari-no-jutsu---cloth-binding-technique-">–( Nunoshibari no Jutsu - Cloth Binding Technique )–</h4> <p>The shinobi uses a giant roll of cloth to wrap their target and, of course, infuses it with chakra. Not only does this make it significantly stronger (as one would hope, seeing as cloth is not generally known for its ability to restrain superhuman ninjas), but it also lays a foundation upon which various sealing jutsu can be applied, should the shinobi performing this technique, or one of their allies, know any.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Upkeep: 12</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Accuracy: -8</li> <li>Speed: 20, Delay 10</li> <li>Requires: 50 yards of cloth</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Using this against a target without a -4 or greater Immobilization penalty causes its Accuracy penalty to be doubled (to -16), and explicitly prevents that penalty from being removed (such as by performing this as a Sneak Attack) or reduced. While the cloth is thrown from a distance (and guided by chakra), it’s relatively slow-moving and very obvious. If this hits, the target is immediately placed at a -10 immobilization penalty, which cannot be reduced or negated without breaking free of this technique. The person trapped inside is unable to take any non-Interrupt action other than struggling to escape. Additionally, they cannot use equipment or perform any task which would require the use of their hands or arms. This is a Speed 4 action that allows for a grapple check to escape, with them rolling as the defender against you, using your NDB in place of PDB. If the defender fails to break free, it applies a Stun 10.</p> <p>Once someone is trapped, seals can be applied to the Cloth Bind, with varying effects. Exclusive Seals placed on the Cloth Blind count against your normal limit. Any Accuracy penalties normally associated with these techniques do not apply; instead, they receive a +6 Accuracy bonus. Note that these seals are applied to the cloth bind itself, not the individual (and as such, escaping would end all the effects)–indeed, it is impossible to apply seals to someone trapped inside Cloth Binding, as the cloth disrupts the delicate chakra frameworks needed.</p> <h6 id="five-elements-seal">Five Elements Seal</h6> <p>The victim cannot spend Chakra in any way, and all Upkeeps they have (including Upkeep 0) end immediately and cannot be reestablished.</p> <h6 id="sacred-silence-seal">Sacred Silence Seal</h6> <p>The target becomes unable to produce noise; any sounds they would make are muted (even without their mouth being covered). Additionally, their chakra, and that of the cloth bind, cannot be seen or sensed (by doujutsu, chakra sensors, or natural chakra). If they have any of those senses, they are similarly disabled.</p> <h6 id="influence-seal">Influence Seal</h6> <p>It is impossible for the victim to perform any sort of taijutsu.</p> <h6 id="evil-sealing-method">Evil Sealing Method</h6> <p>If the Upkeep used to pay for the technique is ended, the person who originally paid it has 20 IC to resume the Upkeep (a Speed 10 action) before the Cloth Bind’s effects ends; if they do so, the cloth bind remains intact and functioning normally.</p> <p>If all four of those seals are applied, the cloth bind no longer has an upkeep and becomes effectively permanent, counting as a single Exclusive Seal (despite multiple being present on the cloth). At this point it is also possible for someone who knows Nemurihane (the B-rank Genjutsu) to apply a Rune-Inscribing Technique to the Cloth Bind (which does not count against your limit for Exclusive Seals). This will allow the victim to be placed in, and woken from, a state of suspended animation at will. A total of 100+NDB*20 or more damage will destroy the cloth bind, freeing the trapped individual; the cloth takes damage from anything targeting them before they do. It is also impossible to target the victim with medical ninjutsu or Genjutsu while they are still trapped inside the cloth. The victim can be freed by anyone able to remain in melee, as a Speed 25, Delay 25 action which can be Aborted and restarted until the IC spent freeing them totals to 25. After the cloth bind has been escaped (by any means), all seals on it dissipate and the cloth itself becomes useless.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
