Even so, a wise ninja, magical or not, will equip themselves with a wide variety of tools. True, you could create a thick bank of fog instead of throwing down a smoke bomb–but that smoke bomb’s faster, and less taxing.</p> <p>Every piece of equipment has a cost in Ryo, the world’s most commonly-used currency. You can get Ryo in two primary ways, the Money: Requisition and Money: Savings abilities.</p> <p>Items bought with Requisition can be traded in and replaced whenever you visit your village. Items bought with Savings are yours forever, for better or worse; if you lose them (or break them), they won’t be replaced.</p> <p>Items can be divided into two broad categories: Consumable and non-consumable. Consumable items are gone once you use them. These are things like smoke bombs, poisons, and explosives. Used-up consumables can be restocked when you get back to your village, if they were bought with Requisition. Non-consumable items can be broken, destroyed, or lost, but usually aren’t. These are things like ropes, weapons, and lockpicks. Ranged weapons are not destroyed on use (hit or miss).</p> <p>Items with the ‘Armor’ tag indicate that they are, as you’d expect, Armor. Some might have penalties for wearing them, but not all. Most importantly, you can only have one type of Armor protecting any given body location (which the armor itself will state where it applies to). You can, for RP purposes, wear multiple types over each other, but mechanically you must pick which you wish to use and consider to be wearing for its benefits. While you can remove armor in combat, you can’t easily put it on, unless the Armor itself states otherwise.</p> <h4 id="equipment-weight">Equipment weight</h4> <p>In some cases, equipment weight will come up. Weights are listed below.</p> <ul> <li>Large Gourd: 66 lb (Full)</li> <li>Small Gourd: 16 lb (Full)</li> <li>Any melee weapon: 5 lb</li> <li>Any large ranged weapon: 3 lb</li> <li>Any other ranged weapon: Trivial</li> <li>Poisons: Trivial</li> <li>Basic equipment/supplies/unlisted: Trivial</li> </ul> <h4 id="weapon-specific-actions">Weapon-Specific Actions</h4> <h6 id="draw-weapon">Draw Weapon</h6> <p><em>(Speed 3)</em><br> Weapons are typically carried attached to one’s person somehow; swords have sheathes, a pair of tonfa might be tucked through belt holsters, a fan could be strapped across your back, and so forth. Drawing a weapon is retrieving it from wherever you have it stored and placing it in your hands. At this point you can use it to attack, parry, or whatever else you please, with the downside being that your hands aren’t free for, say, handseals. You may also draw a weapon at the start of combat (when you roll initiative), without taking an action to do so. If you wish, you can draw two weapons as a single Speed 5 action. Note that you only need to Draw weapons you intend to hold and use in melee. This Speed to attack with thrown or multi-thrown weapons includes the time needed to retrieve them from holsters. The same is true for Bows.</p> <p>Be aware: While holding one or more weapons, you can still make basic unarmed attacks. You cannot, however, use Unarmed or Combo jutsu. Grappling is still possible as long as you have at least one hand free.</p> <h6 id="sheathe-weapon">Sheathe Weapon</h6> <p><em>(Speed 6)</em><br> You put a weapon you’re holding away, in some secure fashion. If you’re holding two weapons, you can put them both away at the same time.</p> <h6 id="discard-weapon">Discard Weapon</h6> <p><em>(Speed 1, or Speed +2)</em><br> You drop or toss aside a weapon. Done normally, this is a Speed 1 action. However, it may also be used alongside an Interrupt (such as a defensive ninjutsu technique) by increasing that action’s Speed (after AP reductions) by 2.</p> <h6 id="retrieve-weapon">Retrieve Weapon</h6> <p><em>(Speed 5)</em><br> You pick up a weapon on the ground. This can be your weapon, or someone else’s, as long as nobody’s currently holding it. You can only pick up one melee weapon at a time with this action, and must be able to physically reach it (which may require you to move first). You can also pick up DEX/10 used throwing weapons and holster them appropriately.</p> <p>If two people decide to be stubborn and attempt to retrieve the same weapon on the same IC, they can either allow only one of them to pick it up, or both can pick up the weapon (in which case, they both pick up only the one contested weapon, even if it was a throwing weapon, and can not pick up others), at which point both are considered to be wielding the weapon, causing them both to take the effects of being in a grapple, as listed under ‘Grab’ (E-rank Grapple jutsu), except that other grapple jutsu may not be used (as you are not grappling them, but a weapon), and both must keep one hand on the weapon (rather than on the defender). Ignite damage is not transferred through this ‘grapple’, but all other rules apply. Both people holding the weapon can use it to attack the other person with, but neither can holster or throw it, and the weapon itself can not be used for the Disarm action (though it can be used to parry a disarm attempt).</p> <h6 id="disarm">Disarm</h6> <p><em>(Weapon’s Speed +4)</em><br> You use a weapon you’re holding to knock an enemy’s out of their grasp, usually by hitting it at such an angle, and with enough force, that it becomes physically impossible for them to hold onto it. This is a basic weapon attack that does no damage, but if it hits you knock their weapon STR/10 yards in any direction (if straight up, the weapon lands at their feet but cannot be retrieved for STR/10 IC). Trying to Parry a Disarm attempt has a -3 penalty. Small weapons cannot disarm Large weapons, and Large weapons lack the finesse to be used to disarm at all.</p> <h2 id="melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</h2> <p>Next to a weapon’s name are various characteristics of the weapon, useful for determining what kind of wounds it inflicts and what jutsu it may be used with. Of particular note is the “Two-Handed” descriptor, meaning the weapon in question may only be used by holding it in both hands. When being used two-handed, the weapon increases its user’s stat-derived Damage Bonus by 33%. This multiplication only applies to the STR/15 (or similar stat-derived divisor, if it’s somehow changed), and does not apply to abilities or jutsu which add to or subtract from your damage bonus.</p> <h5 id="blunt-weapons">Blunt Weapons</h5> <h6 id="bo-staff-blunt-polearm-two-handed">Bo Staff (Blunt, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A weapon which sees more use in martial arts than among ninja, the bo staff is traditionally six feet long, though ninja scale their staves to their users. The bo is, essentially, a hard wooden pole, sometimes tapered at the ends.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 14</li> <li>Damage: 8d10</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Attacks from a Bo Staff do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects). You can use Unarmed Taijutsu (but not Combo taijutsu) even while wielding a Bo Staff, so long as you are not wielding any other weapons. When attacking, you may “dual wield” a Bo staff with itself by attacking with both ends allowing it to be considered to have the ‘Dual’ tag for the attack, but when doing you lose its Accuracy bonus. If used in this way, you do not receive the Two-handed damage bonus multiplier.</li> </ul> <h6 id="gunbai-large-blunt-fan-two-handed">Gunbai (Large, Blunt, Fan, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Large fans with reinforced wooden slats, these were originally used by generals to signal soldiers on battlefields. Then some ninja was looking for a way to be unique, got ahold of the idea, and, well… the usual. Though they’re several feet long, these fans do (impressively) fold.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 8d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: Blocking weapons with a Gunbai reduces their damage by 50%, rather than 25%.</li> </ul> <h6 id="kusari-gama-blunt-chain">Kusari-gama (Blunt, Chain)</h6> <p>A weapon that consists of an adapted kama on a narrow metal chain with a heav, typically iron, weight on one end. Some shinobi have been known to replace the kama with a heavy metal spike.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 8d10</li> <li>Range: 5</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: The stats above are for the weighted ball end, which is attached via chain to a Kama (which uses the standard Kama statistics). Using this weapon takes both hands, but does not grant the normal Two-Handed bonus (or the tag). The weighted end can be used to perform Disarm or Grab (the E-Rank Grapple jutsu) with its normal range, and grants a +3 to Grapple checks it’s used with.</li> </ul> <p>Grappling someone with this weapon does not impose a penalty on your own Dodge or Parry interrupts, though the ball end of the weapon can not be used for anything else while a grapple is maintained, Ignite statuses do not transfer between grapplers, and you must keep ahold of the weapon to maintain the grapple. The person you’re grappling can not move further away from you than this weapon’s range: if they would do something that would move them further, you are moved as well (and vice-versa), and either may attempt to restrain the other (as described under Grab). You can always elect to end the grapple by simply discarding the weapon (see the Discard weapon action), whether or not you are in control of the grapple. Once someone is grappled with this weapon, you can perform any Grapple jutsu of C or lower rank on them, with the exception of Headbutt, Suplex, and Pressure Point. Joint Lock uses the weapon’s damage instead of unarmed attack damage. The weapon is considered to have unlimited limbs.</p> <h6 id="nunchaku-blunt">Nunchaku (Blunt)</h6> <p>A pair of wooden handles attached by a length of rope or chain, a single nunchaku is generally wielded by grabbing one handle and using it to spin the other and bludgeon someone. Paired they do the same thing, except twice as much.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 80 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 5d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Special: Consecutive basic attacks (or dual wield attacks with itself, see below) with Nunchaku with no other non-interrupt actions between them lowers its Speed by 1 and increases your Damage Bonus by 0.5, to a maximum of -4 and +2. The Speed reduction acts in all ways as if you’d spent AP to do so (and follows its normal limits). By using a single Nunchaku with both hands (which does not grant the Two-handed tag), You can add the “Dual” tag to any attack you make with a Nunchaku, but you lose its Accuracy bonus for that attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="sai-blunt-dual">Sai (Blunt, Dual)</h6> <p>A martial arts weapon, the sai consists of a single main, dagger-like spike, with two prongs extending from the handle. The points of this weapon are blunted, and the prongs reinforced; it’s a primarily defensive weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 75 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 4d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: +2 Parry. After you successfully parry any non-Large weapon with your sai, you may elect to perform the Disarm action as an Interrupt against your opponent as a Stamina 12 action, using your parry roll as your attack roll for the disarm. If you successfully Disarm your opponent in this way, you can elect to catch their weapon in your other hand rather than send it flying, so long as you aren’t holding anything in it already.</li> </ul> <h6 id="tetsubo-large-blunt-polearm-two-handed">Tetsubo (Large, Blunt, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Rarely used among ninja, except ones who want to demonstrate how overpoweringly strong they are, the tetsubo is a large wooden pole, often with iron studs on the business end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: 12d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Speed: 16, Delay 8</li> <li>Special: Stun 6. Attacks from a Tetsubo do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects). Anyone attempting to parry this weapon takes a -3 to their parry roll, and this weapon reduces blocking by an additional 25% (which means, normally, that blocking does not reduce its damage at all).</li> </ul> <h6 id="tonfa-blunt-dual">Tonfa (Blunt, Dual)</h6> <p>Originating from a small island off the shore of fire country, the tonfa began as a martial arts implement, which ninja have seen fit to ‘borrow’ and upgrade. A single tonfa is essentially a wooden bar the length of the wielder’s forearm with a handle 1/4 of the way from one end. Typically wielded in pairs, they’re an unorthodox but sometimes-effective weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 4d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Special: +1 to Parry, and you can parry unarmed attacks with a Tonfa. You may block weapon attacks and reduce their damage by 50% (rather than the normal 25%), though after doing so three times, the Tonfa breaks.</li> </ul> <h6 id="tsubasa-large-blunt-fan-polearm-two-handed-umbrella">Tsubasa (Large, Blunt, Fan, Polearm, Two-Handed, Umbrella)</h6> <p>This complicated weapon looks like a lance with a sail attached to it. In a slick movement, the shinobi fits a brace around their chest and pulls a cord to deploy a sort of fan that allows them to glide. Though in it’s lance form, it has it’s own uses.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 600 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 19</li> <li>Damage: 14d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Special: You may Block as a Speed 6 Interrupt with a Tsubasa; when used this way, both you and the Tsubasa take the (reduced, by blocking) damage from the attack. Tsubasas have 500 Durability; once it has taken that much daamge, it breaks. Villages do not bother to repair broken weapons (and will not replace or repair them if bought with Savings), but can repair them if they have Durability remaining.</li> </ul> <p>While Mounted, moving while you attack with the Tsubasa has no accuracy penalty, since you are using it as a Lance. Stationary attacks still have the penalty. If your attack’s final Speed is 20 or higher, you gain +150% Wounding to attacks made with this weapon.</p> <p>While falling, you can deploy the sail as a Speed 6 action which will allow you to slow your fall sufficiently to avoid taking any damage or injuries from it, regardless of height.</p> <h6 id="umbrella-blunt">Umbrella (Blunt)</h6> <p>Yes, umbrellas. Ones used in combat are reinforced with metal or hard wood, making them semi-decent bludgeoning weapons, and most have a sharp, pointed tip added at the end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 11</li> <li>Damage: 6d10</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: You may Block as a Speed 6 Interrupt with an Umbrella; when used this way, both you and the Umbrella take the (reduced, by blocking) damage from the attack. Umbrellas have 250 Durability; once it has taken that much damage, it breaks. Villages do not bother to repair broken weapons (and will not replace or repair them if bought with Savings), but can repair them if they have durability remaining.</li> </ul> <h4 id="piercing-weapons">Piercing Weapons</h4> <h6 id="kama-piercing-dual">Kama (Piercing, Dual)</h6> <p>Farming tools used by the ninja of old, back before they had awesome chakra-powered pyrotechnics. A kama is pretty much a short wooden handle with a slightly-curved blade at a right angle to it on one end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 3d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Speed: 11</li> </ul> <h6 id="ninja-to-piercing-sword">Ninja-to (Piercing, Sword)</h6> <p>A small, light-weight straight-bladed sword with a traditionally square-shaped handguard, the ninja-to is, as its name may suggest, favored by shinobi.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 9</li> <li>Damage: 7d10</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: Drawing and Sheathing a ninja-to is a Speed 2 action, both of which can be reduced by Quick Draw. Drawing and Sheathing a Ninja-to can also be done alongside an interrupt, increasing the speed of that Interrupt by 2 (which is also reduced by Quick Draw).</li> </ul> <h6 id="tanto-small-piercing-sword">Tanto (Small, Piercing, Sword)</h6> <p>A straight-bladed dagger, usually double-edged, between six and twelve inches long. Good for stabbing people! Popular among reasonably wealthy civilians for purposes of self defense.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Damage: 5d6</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Ignores armor.</li> </ul> <h6 id="yari-large-piercing-polearm-two-handed">Yari (Large, Piercing, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>An infantry weapon among mundane armies, the Yari is about as simple as a polearm can get: wooden pole, straight wooden blade with a sharp point that you stick into other people.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 14</li> <li>Damage: 8d12</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: This weapon’s damage is considered 20% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. Attacks from a Yari do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects).</li> </ul> <h5 id="slashing-weapons">Slashing Weapons</h5> <h6 id="katana-slashing-sword">Katana (Slashing, Sword)</h6> <p>The traditional samurai sword, with a slightly curved blade and wavy design along the edge due to its forging.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 10d10</li> <li>Speed: 13</li> <li>Special: By taking a -1 to Accuracy, you can add the “Dual” tag to a Katana you use it with a Wakizashi to attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="naginata-large-slashing-polearm-two-handed">Naginata (Large, Slashing, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A weapon almost as traditional as the katana, and even more rarely appropriated for use by ninja, the naginata is essentially a wooden pole with a sword-like curved blade on the end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 16</li> <li>Damage: 6d12</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Attacks from a Naginata do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects).</li> </ul> <h6 id="nodachi-large-slashing-sword-two-handed">Nodachi (Large, Slashing, Sword, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A massive curved sword, it is functionally a two-handed version of a katana made longer in both handle and blade. It is a weapon made to test the limits of practical weapon sizes, which means every blacksmith makes their nodachi differently.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 14</li> <li>Damage: 11d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -1</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Special: Anyone attempting to parry a Nodachi has a -4 penalty; however, when attempting to parry using a Nodachi, your parry roll suffers a -1 penalty.</li> </ul> <h6 id="tessen-small-slashing-fan-dual">Tessen (Small, Slashing, Fan, Dual)</h6> <p>A small war fan, used, much like their larger counterparts, to signal troops in combat. Or, if you’re a ninja, to kill people with. The tessen, as used by ninja, is a handheld folding or non-folding fan with, at the very least, a sharpened metal edge.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 60 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 6d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Tessen may be used to parry unarmed attacks.</li> </ul> <h6 id="trench-knives-small-slashing-dual">Trench Knives (Small, Slashing, Dual)</h6> <p>Essentially knuckle dusters with the blunt or knobbed front replaced by a serrated blade which extends several inches past the end of the fingers. They are most often used as a pair.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 40 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 6d6</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: +1 Accuracy when using two of them to attack as a dual-wield attack. You may perform handseals while holding trench knives, increasing the Seal Speed by 3 (whether you’re wielding one or two of them).</li> </ul> <h6 id="wakizashi-small-slashing-sword">Wakizashi (Small, Slashing, Sword)</h6> <p>Among samurai, this is the traditional partner of the katana. The wakizashi has a blade about a foot and a half long. It’s a relatively small sword, which makes it easier for follow-up attacks in concert with its heavier partner.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 8d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: By taking a -1 to Accuracy, you can add the “Dual” tag to a Wakizashi if you use it with a Katana to attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="zanbato-large-slashing-sword-two-handed">Zanbato (Large, Slashing, Sword, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Zanbato were created as a result of the nodachi’s historied lack of specificity; at some point blacksmiths began to compete with one another to see who could create the most oversized sword. The result is the Zanbato, which border on impossible to utilize effectively, though where there is a will..</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 400 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: 15d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -4</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Special: A Zanbato’s base parry speed is increased by 2.

On the short end it has a handle just long enough to wrap one’s hand around, typically wrapped in cloth to improve the grip, and a metal ring on the end of that.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 2d6</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/4</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Special: Kunai may be used as a melee weapon, in which case they gain the Dual tag and +1 Accuracy, with an additional +1 to Parry.</li> </ul> <h5 id="shuriken-small-slashing-thrown">Shuriken (Small, Slashing, Thrown)</h5> <p>The other classic ninja weapon, even more famous than the kunai, shuriken are small, flat four-pointed metal stars thrown at opponents to distract and mildly injure them. Like kunai, shuriken are black, making them less reflective and generally harder to spot in low-light conditions.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 5 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 1d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/4</li> <li>Speed: 5</li> </ul> <h5 id="senbon-small-piercing-thrown">Senbon (Small, Piercing, Thrown)</h5> <p>Large metal needles, traditionally used in acupuncture. Rarely, particularly skilled shinobi will use these with devastating efficiency. Frequently, particularly overconfident shinobi will use this with depressing ineptitude.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 1d4</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/5</li> <li>Speed: 7</li> <li>Special: Ignores armor and half of an opponent’s DR.</li> </ul> <h5 id="large-thrown">Large Thrown</h5> <p>Fuuma Shuriken (Large, Slashing, Thrown)</p> <p>A fairly complex device, a fuuma shuriken is four curved blades that can fold together and be used as an improvised blade in melee combat, or unfolded and locked open, taking on a pinwheel shape, to be thrown.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (4+STR/10)d12</li> <li>Range: STR/3</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack’s total damage, to a maximum of +150% (so, if they dodged and you hit by 3 points you’d do 1.3 times damage, and that number would be reduced by the effects of partial success); if it is blocked, it simply gets +25% to its damage, instead. HP-based defenses which do not require a roll are considered to have a roll of 10. You may also use the Fuuma Shuriken as a melee weapon, in which case it loses all of its other special effects and deals only 6d12 damage.</li> </ul> <h5 id="large-star-shuriken-large-piercing-thrown">Large Star Shuriken (Large, Piercing, Thrown)</h5> <p>The name is about as literal as it could be: it’s essentially a shuriken many, many times larger than a normal shuriken, up to four feet from the tip of one point to the opposite. It generally sees limited use in combat due to its cumbersome size.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: (6+STR/10)d12</li> <li>Range: STR/3</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack’s total damage, to a maximum of +200%; if it is blocked, it simply gets +25% to its damage, instead. HP-based defenses which do not require a roll are considered to have a roll of 10. This weapon’s damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. Because these are large and encumbering, they are typically worn somehow strapped to the back; for each large star shuriken beyond the first you are carrying you take a -1 Immobilization penalty which does not fade over time like normal, though reducing the number of Large Star Shuriken you carry will lower it.</li> </ul> <h4 id="exotic">Exotic</h4> <h5 id="bow-daikyu">Bow, Daikyu</h5> <p>A large bow, generally bigger than its wielder at six feet or so high. The upper ‘half’ is actually 2/3 or so of the total length. As most ninja find these near-useless in combat, they tend to see more use in assassination missions.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: (STR/4) dice; die size determined by arrow</li> <li>Accuracy: -10</li> <li>Range: STR</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Special: The bow uses double your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may take a Speed 10 Aim action which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. If you have to take any action which requires movement (including dodging), you lose the benefits of your aim.</li> </ul> <h5 id="bow-recurve-hunting">Bow, Recurve Hunting</h5> <p>Shinobi really never saw a purpose for shooting a bow quickly because of how much stamina was required for the draw. Plus, they weren’t looking at killing a target in several shots, but rather, one big shot and ending the fight quickly. This bow is designed for hunting, but with the horses used in the warring states era, the tactics evolved to incorporate these bows to specifically be used on the backs of horses. A small bow with a tight string, although with less range, they fire several shots with terrifying precision.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 300 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6) dice; dice size determined by arrow</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Range: STR /3</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: Using a bow always takes two hands. Consecutive hits against the same target cause follow-up attacks with this weapon to gain increased Wounding, gaining +20% per hit, up to a maximum of +100% (after 6 hits), which lasts until you miss a shot, perform an attack without utilizing this weapon, or use a Weapon Taijutsu with this weapon, which gains the bonus Wounding percentage to its damage, but then resets it back to +0% afterward. Combat Acupuncture and Surgical Precision can be used with this weapon.</li> </ul> <p>While Mounted, you have +2 Accuracy against unmounted targets and ignore the Mounted penalty to Accuracy.</p> <h5 id="bow-yumi">Bow, Yumi</h5> <p>Technically, it’s called a hankyu, and kyudo practitioners would be horridly offended to hear shinobi calling all bows of this sort ‘yumis’. However, ninja hardly care! The yumi is a much smaller bow, typically not more than four feet long.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6) dice; die size determined by arrow</li> <li>Range: STR /2</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Accuracy: -6</li> <li>Special: You gain +25% to your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may use a Speed 8 Aim action which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the Speed of your Dodge action by 3.</li> </ul> <h5 id="arrow-piercing">Arrow (Piercing)</h5> <p>These are necessary to use a bow in combat! Specifically, arrows are the ammunition for bows, and each attack you make with a bow requires you to use an arrow. Arrows can usually be retrieved after battle. Arrows are expensive not because of their construction, but because ones of the quality that chakra-using ninja need are hard to come by; shuriken and kunai are competitively mass produced, arrows are not.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Damage: d12</li> </ul> <h5 id="arrow-armor-piercing-piercing">Arrow, Armor Piercing (Piercing)</h5> <p>Arrows with narrow steel tips that excel in penetrating armor and the like. These ignore the effects of enemy armor when dealing damage, but lose something in terms of killing power due to creating smaller wounds.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50</li> <li>Damage: d8</li> </ul> <h5 id="arrow-feather-piercing">Arrow, Feather (Piercing)</h5> <p>A simple arrow that is easily mass-produced and carries well through the air, but lacks the higher quality of other types that allow them to punch harder into, and sometimes through, targets.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10 Ryo</li> <li>Damage: d6</li> </ul> <h2 id="ninja-tools">Ninja Tools</h2> <h5 id="blank-scroll">Blank Scroll</h5> <p>A large scroll. Most of the time these are carried rolled up to save space. They’re useless, aside from the fact that a few sealing jutsu make use of them.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="blood-increasing-pill">Blood Increasing Pill</h5> <p>These pills contain a peculiar mix of chemicals that, when consumed by someone capable of using chakra (such as a ninja) will allow their body to rapidly replenish lost blood. When you take one of these pills you regain RES/10 HP (but not Vitality) each IC, for 50 IC. During this duration you take only one third damage from poison, and no damage from effects caused by bleeding (such as certain wounds). Using a Blood Pill is a Speed 10 action.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="caltrops">Caltrops</h5> <p>Small bits of metal that are basically just four short spikes attached at a center; no matter how they land, there’ll always be a metal spike pointing upwards. The typical use is to scatter them across the ground to impede movement through an area. As a Speed 10 action you can throw them up to STR/6 yards to cover an Area 5 in caltrops. Anyone moving through the area going at more than half their maximum movement speed takes 1d4 damage for every IC they spend moving through the area; this damage has no Damage Bonus component, and cannot inflict wounds.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 20 Ryo for enough caltrops to cover one 5 yard area</li> <li>Tags: Consumable, Environmental</li> </ul> <h5 id="cloth">Cloth</h5> <p>Broad, sturdy cloth that looks like bandages, or perhaps mummification wraps. This comes in large rolls of up to 200 yards; carrying more than one roll inflicts a -1 immobilization penalty for each beyond the first (not due to weight, but because they’re bulky). Confine Scroll Seals can carry one roll each.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 3 Ryo per yard.</li> </ul> <h5 id="container-small">Container, Small</h5> <p>A container, usually a gourd, clay jug, or waterskin, commonly worn at the hip. One container can hold 2 gallons of water or another substance. For every two small containers or fraction thereof beyond the second, you suffer a -1 penalty to dodge due to encumberance.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="container-large">Container, Large</h5> <p>A large gourd or other sort of container, several feet long and usually worn on the back. It’s heavy and bulky, but not quite enough to restrict the mobility of a well-trained shinobi. It can hold up to 8 gallons of water, but you can only carry one with you (due to its size!).</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="flash-bomb">Flash Bomb</h5> <p>Flash bombs are devices which, when ignited, produce brilliant flashes of light. Anyone within Area 5 of the location they’re thrown at suffers a -3 Visibility penalty for the next 10 IC. It is a Speed 4 action to throw one, and you can throw them up to STR/5 yards.</p> <p>You may also drop a flash bomb when Dodging as a Speed +4 Link. Used in this way, the Flash Bomb’s Area is centered on (but does not affect) you, and applies its Visiblity Penalty to the attacker (modifying their attack’s Accuracy accordingly), but applies only to that roll (rather than for 10 IC).</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="instrument">Instrument</h5> <p>A wood-wind, string, or drum made of high-quality materials that are actually capable of conducting not just the sounds made with them, but chakra along with them, allowing for techniques to be carried by sound in ways they could not ordinarily be with one’s voice (or chakra) alone. In combat they follow the normal rules for handling weapons (drawing, sheathing, etc), and are <strong>always</strong> considered two-handed (meaning things that prevent you from using two-handed weapons, or interact with them, such as grapples or wounds, apply to them likewise).</p> <p>Instruments, regardless of their specific type, allow you to convert the normal Chakra cost of a Genjutsu into an equivalent Stamina cost, +5. In doing so, you remove the Seal Speed of the Genjutsu, but add its modified Seal Speed to the Genjutu’s base Speed, along with an equivalent amount of Delay (Seal Speed 3 becomes +3 Speed, Delay 3). By default, only Genjutsu with the Area of Effect tag can be converted by an Instrument in this way, though in so doing it also allows you to make your Genjutsu distinguish between allies and enemies for who it will and will not affect.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Instrument</li> </ul> <h5 id="lantern">Lantern</h5> <p>An iron lantern with a shutter. It needs oil to keep burning. Mirrors inside of the casing help shape the light. It can also be turned off by closing the shutter, but this swallows the light and will need to be relit.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 40 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="oil-flask">Oil Flask</h5> <p>A small wooden flask of oil used to light a lantern. It can be thrown at someone as a Taijutsu attack, Range 10, which deals no damage but applies the Oil to them as a Speed 5 action, increasing the next Ignite they take by 1, which does not stack with repeated applications; if thrown on someone already on fire, it increases their existing Ignite status by 1 (which can be applied repeatedly). One Flask offers 4 lightings of a lantern or burnable source. However, throwing it consumes it all.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> <li>Tag: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="ninja-wire">Ninja Wire</h5> <p>High tension 16-gauge wire. It is generally only available in ninja villages, and comes in spools with various lengths of wire.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 15 Ryo per 10 yards.</li> </ul> <h5 id="rope">Rope</h5> <p>I refuse to explain what this is. Individual lengths of rope can be purchased up to 300 feet (100 yards), but there’s nothing stopping you from tying a few together. Tying somebody up requires 10 yards of rope, and the person in question to not be resisting.</p> <p>You can tie someone up with ropes. If so, roll Espionage +10 to see how good your knots were. The result, or 20, is the difficulty of escaping. The user can try to slip the knots (Espionage skill roll, +DEX/10) which takes 5 minutes to attempt (they can hide that they are doing so via an opposed Espionage roll). This can be attempted repeatedly.</p> <p>You can also attempt to snap the ropes using brute force. This calls for a roll of 1d20 + (Athletics /5) + (STR /10) against a target of 30, requires a Stamina 25 roll, and is done instantly, but repeated attempts cannot be made (either you’re strong enough to break the ropes, or you’re not).</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10 Ryo per 5 yards.</li> </ul> <h5 id="plague-mask">Plague Mask</h5> <p>A leather mask filtered with thatch containing herbs that are good for breathing fresh air and blocking air poisons and smoke. You will need to replace these Spice Pouches in order to keep yourself preserved. It is not air tight, and does nothing to help you breathe underwater. When wearing the mask, you have -4 to Stamina checks due to the effort required to breathe through it. Putting one on in combat is a Speed 5 action.</p> <p>Wearing an plague mask with a still-fresh spice pouch makes the wearer immune to external suffocation penalties (being inside an unbreathable cloud would not affect them; being physically choked would) and provides a +8 bonus to Resistance rolls against statuses that would be inflicted by breathing something in (such as poison mist); the mask is not perfectly air-tight.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Tag: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="spice-pouch">Spice Pouch</h5> <p>Sharp smelling herbs to be put inside of a Plague Mask. They last and hardly need to be replaced. Each pouch only needs to be replaced once every 3 hours.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="smoke-bomb">Smoke Bomb</h5> <p>Paper balls small enough to be easily held in one hand, when thrown at the ground they burst and release wide clouds of smoke. Smoke bombs have a range of STR/5 yards, and can be thrown as a Speed 4 action. When thrown, it releases a cloud of thick smoke with an Area of 5 that applies a -6 Visiblity Penalty within its area, for 20 IC.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable, Environmental</li> </ul> <h5 id="soldier-pill">Soldier Pill</h5> <p>The proper name is ‘military ration pills’, but the term soldier pill is more commonly used among shinobi. They’re less rations than fast-acting performance-enhancing drugs. Though every village has a slightly different recipe, the pills are all marble-sized and black or dark brown. When eaten, they have the approximate flavor and texture of sawdust.</p> <p>These pills are essentially just condensed stimulants and nutrients; taking one immediately lowers you a Fatigue category, and gives you +5 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the next hour. Doing so is a Speed 10 action in battle. You may only take one per battle, and no more than RES/50 per day.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="sound-pads">Sound Pads</h5> <p>Bells on the body, Drum pads, or some other type of attachment that can be strapped to the body to create sound in some easy (but deliberate) manner. This allows you to play an Instrument while your hands are occupied (normally, they require both hands to play an Instrument). However, they do not benefit from any abilities related to Instruments, allowing for only the base effects of Instruments to be utilized.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 75 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Instrument</li> </ul> <h4 id="survival">Survival</h4> <h5 id="antidote">Antidote</h5> <p>Antidotes to several of the more popular and lethal poisons which shinobi use are widely available, for somewhat obvious reasons. A single dose of an antidote costs half the amount for a single dose of a poison; multiple doses cost half as much as the first. So, buying 2 doses of antidote for a regular injury poison would be (100 + 50) 150 ryo, and buying 4 doses of antidote for regular inhalation poison would be (200 + 3 * 100) 500 ryo.</p> <p>Taking a dose of an Antidote is a Speed 6 action, and immediately cures you of the poison in question and all its lingering effects. Antidotes that act quickly enough to be useful in emergencies, such as combat, aren’t gentle on the body, with each applying a -2 penalty to your Accuracy and all d20 rolls for 100 IC. However, for that duration you are immune to the poison in question.</p> <p>When purchasing an antidote, you must specify which Special Effect it inoculates you from unless you are immune to all Special Effects in the Poison, you still take the Poison condition. Poison without a non-damaging effect is stopped as long as you have any antidote in your system.</p> <p>Cost: Varies<br> Tags: Consumable</p> <h5 id="compass">Compass</h5> <p>A small, typically handheld device that has a needle inside a metal case (with a glass cover, so it can be seen) that points, approximately, to magnetic north when held level. These aren’t exactly precise, but they’re good enough most of the time. Notably, they can have trouble working underground or if they get zapped by a lightning jutsu. When trying to navigate the wilderness, having a compass gives a +2 bonus to any Survival rolls. If you also have a map of the country you’re in, this is raised to +4.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="first-aid-kit">First Aid Kit</h5> <p>A collection of bandages, ointments, and antiseptics. First aid kits can be used to stop bleeding from Wounds, as a Speed 10 action per category of wound. They can also cure the status effects Burns or Bleed, with a Speed of (Status Severity * 2), ending one of those status effects. A single first aid kit can do each of those once before being expended.</p> <p>Alternately, it can treat a wound (in the sense of, “this wound has penalty X until treated, and then only penalty Y”). This is a Speed 15 action per wound category, and completely consumes the first aid kit.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="flare">Flare</h5> <p>A handy little pyrotechnic device, a cylinder usually a bit too large to fit comfortably in the palm. When lit (most have built in starters or strikers, to avoid the need for matches) they shine brilliantly, enough that it can be painful to look directly at them without squinting, and become blisteringly hot. They burn out quickly, within half a minute.</p> <p>The vast majority of flares are projectiles, with built-in propellant. Aimed upwards, they’ll launch into the air. During the day, this is typically unnoticed if you’re doing anything other than staring at the spot it’s launched up waiting to see it, and know exactly where it will be. In twilight and darker conditions, however, a flare can be seen for a considerable distance; they’re often used for signalling, though suffer from not being too discrete.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 40 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="map">Map</h5> <p>A map of a given country. It’s usually a really, really good for at least one person on every ninja team to have a map of any country they expect to be going through. These have only basic information about terrain, landmarks, and settlements.</p> <p>Maps come with scroll cases for ease and safety of transportation. A map gives a +4 bonus to any Survival rolls made in the appropriate country, within reason (they would help tracking someone, or finding shelter, but not exploring the inside of a cave).</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> </ul> <h4 id="infiltration">Infiltration</h4> <h5 id="camouflage-kit">Camouflage Kit</h5> <p>Everything you need to blend in with the environment, like a truly sneaky ninja. These come in four flavors: forest/plains, desert, mountainous/rocky, and ‘other’ (covering anything not one of those). A kit may only be used in its corresponding environment.</p> <p>Using a kit takes 15 minutes, and is enough to conceal a person at level 3 Stealth; the stealth roll is made after they’re fully hidden. The exact contents are fairly nonspecific, but regardless, each kit is good for only one use.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="grappling-hook">Grappling Hook</h5> <p>A three- or four-pronged sturdy metal hook. The typical use is to attach it to the end of a rope then throw it over a wall, up a tree, or across a small chasm, and hope it catches on something (such as a piece of architecture, a branch, or a appropriately-shaped rock). The user then climbs the rope to get to their destination!</p> <p>These see limited use among experienced ninja, who typically have ways of easily doing the same thing, but beginners often find them useful, and they can be situationally helpful even for more advanced shinobi.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="lockpicks">Lockpicks</h5> <p>A set of small tools, easily carried in a pocket, used for opening locks in absence of the key. These allow an Espionage roll to be made to open a lock, and also provide a bonus to said roll. That bonus has a maximum of +5, or the user’s Espionage skill ranks, whichever is lower; you have to actually know how to use them to get any benefit. These are reusable, though a roll of 5 or lower on the Espionage check means they break in the attempt (which may still be successful).</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo per +1</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <h5 id="telescope">Telescope</h5> <p>A small pocket telescope, which telescopes out from two inches to close to six. It allows you to effectively see what’s going on up to five hundred yards away, and read reasonably sized text (assuming you have clear line of sight) up to a hundred yards away. Mechanically, this means that any Awareness rolls at a distance up to its maximum (to, say, see when a guard leaves his post) have no penalty.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> </ul> <h2 id="poisons">Poisons</h2> <p>Poisons are nasty business, and one of the murkier aspects of ninja tactics. Certainly, before the days when shinobi had discovered the secrets of chakra manipulation, poisons were a vital part of their arsenal. The proper use of poisons, however, is hard to learn, and in most circumstances just isn’t as useful as being able to shoot fireballs and run up walls. Some ninja, however, still find uses for them.</p> <p>This section is for them! Build a Death Workshop “Poison” is a stand in for any number of substances used by shinobi to debilitate the enemies in ways other than cutting, stabbing, smashing, or burning them. While the exact formula varies from village to village-and often from shinobi to shinobi-the mechanics are the same.</p> <p>The Severity of the Poison you can deploy onto the field is determined by your ranks in Toxicology. You begin with the Poison Base (detailed below), then modify it by applying a Vector and a Special Option.</p> <ul> <li>Poison Base Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Poison Severity: 1 + (Toxicology Ranks)/15</li> <li>Poison Duration: 50 + (Toxicology Ranks)</li> </ul> <p>First, select one of the following ways your poison can be applied: Contact, Injury, Inhalation, or Ingestion.</p> <h5 id="contact">Contact</h5> <p>You may apply the Poison to a Blunt or Slashing weapon as a Speed 10 action. On a hit with that weapon, that target is exposed to your poison and the Poison is consumed.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="injury">Injury</h5> <p>You may apply the poison to a Piercing or Slashing weapon as a Speed 10 action. If you successfully deal at least 1 point of damage with your weapon to someone, that target is exposed to your poison and the Poison is consumed. It also increases the Poison’s Severity by 1.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +25 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="inhalation">Inhalation</h5> <p>Your Poison comes in a Poison Smoke Bomb. The Poison Smoke Bomb creates a -2 Visibility Penalty Cloud, Area 10, which can be thrown up to (5+STR/5) yards as a Speed 5 action. The Cloud lasts for (10 + Toxicology Ranks) IC. Anyone who is not Poisoned that remains within the Cloud for 10 total IC (not consecutive) is exposed to the poison, and anyone with that poison doesn’t count time spent within the cloud towards its duration. Your Poison’s Severity is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1, and its Duration is halved after all other modifiers.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <h5 id="ingested">Ingested</h5> <p>Your poison comes in a dissolvable powder that is useless for weapons, but may be added to a food or water source as a Speed 5 action. When someone eats or drinks the contaminated food source, they are exposed to the poison. Dilution matters, and a single dose of Poison can contaminate (1 + Toxicology Ranks/10) gallons of water or an equivalent amount of other food or drink. The Poison’s Duration is doubled, and its Potency is increased by 1. Ingesting a Poison in the middle of Combat is a Speed 5 action. Regardless of the vector used, when someone is exposed to your poison, you make a Toxicology roll opposed by their Resistance roll.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +75 Ryo</li> </ul> <h4 id="identifying-poison">Identifying Poison</h4> <p>When you or someone else has been poisoned, it’s possible to identify the venom just based on the symptoms. You may do so after 1/10 of the poison’s total duration has passed. At that point, you can roll a Research, Toxicology, or Medicine skill check (your preference) against 20 + (Poison Severity * 5). Success means you’ve identified the poison. If you fail, you may take a Speed 6 action afterwards to try to identify the symptoms, which you may repeat as many times as you like.</p> <h4 id="stacking-poisons">Stacking Poisons</h4> <p>Poisons, and the Poison Status Effect to not stack. Each IC takes only the highest Poison Status Effect in damage. They also only suffer a single Special Effect at a time. If a new Poison Special Effect would be applied, make an opposed Toxicology roll with the previous poison. If the new Poison wins, replace it with the old poison; if the old poison wins, the new poison has no (meaningful) effect. For poisons not listed here, such as those created by jutsu. Any effect of the poison other than the Poison status is considered a “Special Effect.”</p> <h4 id="special-effects">Special Effects</h4> <p>Shinobi mix special ingredients into their poison to debilitate the enemy in unique ways. A Shinobi may mix in one of the following special options into their Poison. With the Rare Poisons Talent, Shinobi may combine two Special Effects into the same poison. Special Effects do however increase the Ryo cost of the Poison according to their individual entries.</p> <h5 id="bark-scorpion">Bark Scorpion</h5> <p>Stings from the bark scorpion aren’t typically fatal; ninja weaponizing the venom distill it to improve the lethality. Despite being exceptionally painful at the point of entry, it’s not likely to kill someone, though the lingering numbness and spasms are certainly unpleasant to deal with.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the victim has a -(1 + (Toxicology Ranks)/10) internal Immobility Penalty, and an equal penalty to all non-resistance Skill Rolls.</p> <h5 id="belladona">Belladona</h5> <p>Also known as devil’s berries, belladona’s poison causes delirium, hallucinations, and weakness.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the victim suffers from Paralysis (2 + Toxicology Ranks/10).</p> <h5 id="box-jellyfish">Box Jellyfish</h5> <p>Though they’re not the deadliest of sea creatures, they’re what most people will imagine when thinking of that. Affliction with this venom results in convulsions, and before long will send a victim into shock.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: The convulsions make it exceptionally difficult to act. You can’t take any action with a base Speed of (20 - Toxicology Ranks/10) or higher.</p> <h5 id="brown-recluse">Brown Recluse</h5> <p>A shy, tiny spider, the brown recluse nonetheless has an especially dangerous venom, especially to civilians; to shinobi, it’s only severely threatening. The poison is slow acting, but still dangerous.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: Your Poison’s duration is doubled.</p> <h5 id="centipede">Centipede</h5> <p>Giant centipedes aren’t actually all that venomous, though their venom causes significant discomfort, and a pervasive sensation of weakness.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +25 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the target’s Physical Damage Bonus is reduced by 0.1 per Toxicology Rank. Further, any wounds caused by the victim are reduced by one category after all other effects, with minor wounds being reduced to no wound. Wounds reduced in this way still break Genjutsu.</p> <h5 id="cone-snail">Cone Snail</h5> <p>A family of brightly-colored, excitingly-patterned snails, the worst of these produce a venom which is a compound of hundreds of different toxins. Aside from pain and swelling at the point of impact, the venom can easily cause respiratory failure.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the target suffers a penalty of (1 + Toxicology Ranks/10) to all Stamina rolls that can’t be removed. Additionally, the target may not Rest or lower their Stamina penalties. If an effect would completely clear their Stamina penalty, the penalty (other than the one from this poison) is instead halved.</p> <h5 id="death-cap">Death Cap</h5> <p>The death cap is one of, if not the, most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Mercifully, there’s no way to process it into a weaponized form.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: Ingested Poison only. For the duration, every 2 IC the target loses 1 RES. This impacts everything you don’t want it to: HP, Vitality, disabling Abilities you no longer qualify for, etc. Someone reduced to RES 0 dies if not provided immediate medical treatment. RES is recovered at a rate of 2 per Week that passes, or twice that with medical treatment.</p> <h5 id="king-cobra">King Cobra</h5> <p>One of the world’s deadliest snakes, the king cobra’s venom is a neurotoxin that quickly leads to blurred vision, disorientation, and muscular paralysis.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the victim has (1 + Toxicology Ranks/20) Shock.</p> <h5 id="manchineel-tree">Manchineel Tree</h5> <p>Nothing about this tree isn’t inimical to human life. The sap and bark are poisonous, the fruit is absurdly toxic, the leaves are sufficient to poison water supplies. Tying people to the tree overnight is a brutal, highly effective method of execution. In practice, ninja use the sap as a toxin, as it keeps best.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For every (20 - Toxicology Ranks/10) consecutive IC the target suffers from the poison, they gain Suffocation 1. They begin recovering from the Suffocation when the poison ends.</p> <h5 id="stonefish">Stonefish</h5> <p>The most venomous fish in the world, it’s commonly agreed upon that having an injured limb amputated is less agonizing than enduring the pain. Though there will be a slow necrosis of flesh around the injury, the real risk is quite immediate.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The Poison’s Potency is increased by (1 + Toxicology Ranks/15).</p> <h5 id="water-hemlock">Water Hemlock</h5> <p>There are multiple varieties of hemlock, with this being by far the most unpleasant. The plant’s sufficiently lethal that coming into contact with it purely by accident in the wild can cause death. It’s a powerful stimulant, leading to intense pain, tremors, disorientation, dizziness, fever, hallucinations, tingling, dilated pupils, respiratory difficulty…</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +50 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: For the duration, the victim has a -(1 + Toxicology Ranks/10) Visibility Penalty. Anyone can attempt to hide from the victim regardless of their Visibility Penalty (or lack thereof), and their cumulative bonus for Searching is reduced by 1.</p> <h5 id="wolfsbane">Wolfsbane</h5> <p>A poisonous plant known also as monkshood, the least of one’s worries are a severe burning sensation at the point of injury, the abdomen, and the face. The more severe ones are staving off paralysis of one’s heart and lungs.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: +100 Ryo</li> </ul> <p>Effect: Your Chakra rolls and Stamina rolls each use the higher of your Chakra Exhaustion penalty and Stamina penalty. Any time you take an action with a Chakra or Stamina cost, you increase both your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina Exhaustion penalty by the higher of (Toxicology Ranks)/10 or what that action would normally increase it by, after all other modifiers.</p> <h2 id="mounts">Mounts</h2> <p>Considered convenient methods of travel for some, and trusted companions by others, mounts (by and large horses, though some opt for more exotic types) are utilized both for travel, and for mounted combat in battle. Though ninja typically disdain being a highly-elevated target unable to move their own feet to avoid danger, there’s no denying the speed and the advantages therein that mounts afford that compliments a shinobi’s classical hit-and-run tactics well, though it is much harder to catch people by surprise, they remain an asset for those that opt to utilize them. Their costs vary by their Breed, and by default Mounts must be purchased with Savings; those of Noble clans can instead opt to purchase them with Requisition, thanks in part to their higher societal standing which sees their wealth and influence enabling them to almost always have a steed for when they wish one, though it reflects poorly upon one’s house to endanger or lose them with any sort of frequency, Noble or not. Regardless of clan standing, you must have learned the ‘Horse Whistle Technique’ in order to purchase a Mount.</p> <p>In battle you can mount a.. mount, as a Speed 5 action so long as you are within Range 2 of your mount. While unmounted, you must utilize the Horse Whistle technique in order to call it to you, which will cause it to move at top speed toward you until it is at Range 0, even if it is attacked or has to go through ground-based effects (such as Caltrops) to do so. 10 IC after it reaches you, it will begin to flee if you do not mount it. You can mount other people’s mounts if they are unmounted and in range, but see Rear, below.</p> <p>Mounts can not enter Stealth, nor can a Rider be in Stealth while riding a mount. You may, however, opt to dismount as part of any action that lets you Hide.</p> <p>A Mount that is brought to 0 HP dies immediately and Rears its rider. If a mount you own dies, you may not re-purchase another until one month (4 OOC days) have passed, which is considered a time of grieving over the loss of the mount, reducing your maximum Willpower by 1. This takes place whether you are a Noble or not.</p> <p>While mounted, the following rules apply:</p> <ul> <li>While mounted, you use the Mount’s movement speed, rather than your own.</li> <li>Mounts are immune to Knockback and effects which would forcibly move them; riders, accordingly, ignore knockback effects of one yard or less (such as Wind God’s Breath), but knockbacks of greater severity will cause them to be forcibly dismounted and knocked prone as a result.</li> <li>Mounts suffer ground effects as normal; while mounted, their rider does not.</li> <li>Mounts do not act of their own accord whilst mounted, and act only when directed by you to, as a Speed 0 action; they understand commands well enough to go in a direction and at a pace you set, and will continue to go in that same general direction, or stop at your intended target, chosen when you act (essentially allowing you to choose to stop at an enemy or ride by them), but will only continue to go in a given direction for 5 IC, at which point it will stop until directed again. Mounts can be commanded to move away from targets while you attack them likewise, but only for 5 IC before they need to be directed to do so again.</li> <li>You are considered 1 Range further away than you actually are against all unmounted targets; this means, ordinarily, any attack with a Range of 0 (unarmed attacks, those of touch range, etc) are simply impossible to perform (except for those with the Large unique). Unmounted targets can attack you, however, so long as they have one range more than is normally needed (by attack-moving or by the range of the technique), by jumping!</li> <li>You can not perform Unarmed Taijutsu, Combo Taijutsu, or begin a Grapple against unmounted targets while you yourself are mounted. They may, however, still attempt to use such jutsu against you.</li> <li>All non-small melee weapons gain a Range of 1 while mounted, unless they already have a listed range.</li> <li>You gain a +2 to Dodge while Mounted, which is lost the first time you attack in battle.</li> <li>You take a -2 to Accuracy while Mounted, except with Polearms, which instead gain +2 Accuracy.</li> <li>Melee weapon attacks while mounted have their physical damage bonus increased by +0.2 per full yard you move as part of your attack, to a maximum of +50% of your stat-based damage bonus.</li> <li>Area of Effect attacks which include someone who is mounted automatically includes their mount. Mounts will automatically block all attacks aimed at them as a Speed 0 defense, and automatically pass all status effect rolls any Elemental Ninjutsu would require them to make.</li> <li>Mounts can be attacked as any other target could be in battle.</li> <li>Mounts fail all genjutsu rolls, but are immune to the sleep condition in combat. Because they are controlled by their rider, status effects beyond Immobility and Stun doesn’t meaningfully impede their actions in battle; if Stunned, a mount immediately stops moving and can not be directed to move again until a number of IC equal to their Stun has worn off (they are frozen in place, essentially).</li> <li>Mounts movement speeds are reduced by 5% per 10% of their maximum vitality missing, but does not take with immobility penalties: you apply the higher penalty between the two. Mounts do not take Wounds (and are accordingly immune to Medical ninjutsu which would interact with them).</li> <li>Mounts that are not actively being ridden understand who their owner is, but are also wary of danger. If attacked while unmounted, they will move away from their attacker for 10 IC at their top speed toward, and then past, their owner, to put their rider between them and danger, beginning on the IC after they were attacked. If attacked again, they will continue to flee for 10 IC at a time (refreshing their ‘flee’ duration if they attacked again whilst fleeing), until they reach a distance of 100 yards from their closest enemy (read: someone who has attacked them), at which point they are considered removed from the battle and may not be recalled by their rider for that combat.</li> <li>Mounts can not enter Stealth, nor can a Rider be in Stealth while riding a mount. You may, however, opt to dismount as part of any action that lets you Hide.</li> <li>Mounts are flighty creatures, and though trained for battle, sometimes still get spooked. At times they may attempt to Rear their rider, raising up and trying to force them off in order to get away from danger. Each Mount has its own listed Rear TN, which is opposed with an Athletics roll to stay mounted. On a failure, you are forcibly dismounted, taking a Stun 2 and knocked Prone. The list of things that causes a Mount to rear are: <ul> <li>When reaching 50%, and again at 0%, of the Mounts Maximum Vitality and HP</li> <li>When you use any Elemental Ninjutsu</li> <li>When your mount is Stunned</li> <li>When your mount is attacked with Taiyoken</li> <li>When you perform any action on a Mount that is not yours</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="dismounting-attack">Dismounting Attack</h4> <p>While mounted, you can as part of an attack (even those you couldn’t normally perform on a Mount, such as an Unarmed Taijutsu) opt to Dismount as a Speed +2 Link to your attack, granting that attack +2 to Accuracy; you can direct your mount to move as you dismount it without issue, and can include your own attack-move distance along side that of your mount’s, though you do not get the damage bonus from being mounted and attack-moving when using a Dismounting Attack.</p> <h4 id="types-of-mounts">Types of Mounts</h4> <p>There are various breeds and qualities of mounts, which are in and of themselves status symbols as much as they are tools of war by shinobi. Below is a list of common and purchasable types, though there are some that may be more rare to find or see.</p> <p>All Mounts have Hit Points equal to half their listed Vitality (and like normal, their Vitality is damaged first).</p> <p>As a reminder: all Mounts must be purchased with Savings, unless you are from a Noble clan, in which case you may purchase them with Requisiton.</p> <h5 id="misaki">Misaki</h5> <p>The Misaki is something of a mixed breed of horse in old war-times. It’s actually a small horse. Something of a War Pony. It’s quite stout and reliable. Though higher rank shinobi have access to larger and more aggressive breeds, the Misaki is a short compact horse capable of navigating through difficult terrain and toughing out harsh conditions. They may not look like much, but you’ll find them very surprising, and while some horses have other advantages, the Misaki are there to help out there fresh shinobi out of the academy during wartime.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 700 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 800</li> <li>Movement Speed: 4.0</li> <li>Rear TN: 20</li> <li>Special: Misaki ignore up to 2 Stun. They cannot be slowed under 2 yds per IC, even with Immo 10. They cannot be moved by environmental effects unless they take damage. Finally, Misaki cannot take damage from moving or Attack-moving due to them able to traverse complicated terrain and tough environments.</li> </ul> <h5 id="tokara">Tokara</h5> <p>This is a more affordable agricultural breed. It’s got longer legs and has a pretty long lifespan. These horses were bred for long hours and pulling heavy loads.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 400 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 600</li> <li>Movement Speed: 5.0</li> <li>Rear TN: 25</li> <li>Special: Your horse may carry one of each item which applies a Dodge penalty for carrying a certain number of them, up to the amount allowed without penalty; in the case of Containers, it can carry two small or one additional Large Gourd. The items (and gourd contents) can be accessed freely the mount’s rider (and not by anyone else).</li> </ul> <h5 id="mongol">Mongol</h5> <p>These breeds of horses were like small tanks. They were fast, dependable, and hearty. You get many of the benefits and none of the downsides of this horse in comparison to a Genin horse.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 1000 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 1100</li> <li>Movement: 6.0</li> <li>Rear TN: 30</li> <li>Requires: Chuunin, or 40 Infamy</li> <li>Special: This horse will not Rear when you use Elemental Ninjutsu while riding it. Furthermore, any upkeep that would apply to your legs you can apply to your Horse’s legs instead. Upon dismounting, concentration is dropped. Furthermore, attacking a dismounted target gives you an additional +1 Accuracy.</li> </ul> <h5 id="yonagumi">Yonagumi</h5> <p>This is the precursor breed that created the Misaki. They have longer legs and still retained the toughness in their genes. These horses were strong, and although the Misaki is a solid mixed breed that offers a lot of safe benefits, the Yonaguni is no pushover.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 900 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 1300</li> <li>Movement: 6.5</li> <li>Rear TN: 35</li> <li>Requires: Chuunin, or 40 Infamy</li> <li>Special: This horse cannot be slowed below 3 yds per IC by any means, and can carry extra Equipment the same way a Tokara can.</li> </ul> <h5 id="marwari">Marwari</h5> <p>Despite the name sounding native in origin, this horse was actually shipped out from a faraway land by traveling merchants that sent these breeds back in an attempt to colonize them for shinobi use. The Marwari is graceful and very well trained. They have ears that curve upward almost like horns, and they’re fast, loyal, and very well trained.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 2000 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 1800</li> <li>Movement: 8.0</li> <li>Rear TN: n/a</li> <li>Requires: Jounin, or 100 Infamy</li> <li>Special: The Marwari will never Rear and will not Flee when attacked; Taiyoken causes it to Flee, rather than Rear. When Stunned, it will not Rear, but will increase your own IC by 3. Marwari reduce Immobility penalties against them by 4.</li> </ul> <h5 id="zorse">Zorse</h5> <p>An experimental crossbreed. This horse is the most dangerous of all and requires the most training. Only a Jounin is truly capable of controlling this horse’s temper. It’s fast, furious, and isn’t afraid to fight instead of run away. Be warned, it may also attack it’s allies if it’s under a lot of stress.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 3000 Ryo</li> <li>Vitality: 2200</li> <li>Movement: 9.0</li> <li>Damage Bonus: 18.0</li> <li>Rear TN: 50</li> <li>Requires: Jounin, or 100 Infamy</li> <li>Special: When ridden by a Jounin, they will not Rear from using Elemental Ninjutsu. Whenever it would otherwise Rear, Zorses join initiative (acting on the IC after the action which caused them to do so), and begin fighting your enemies alongside you. The GM takes control of your horse and can use its abilities freely. The Zorse may also target allies not its owner that are around it. In order to calm a Zorse that has begun rampaging, you must use the Horse Whistle technique. Instead of its normal effects, however, you both roll 1d20; if you roll higer than it, it allows you to regain control of it (removing it from initiative) to function as a normal mount. If you fail, it continues to rampage. It has the following abilities:</li> </ul> <p><strong>Retaliation</strong> <em>(Speed 6)</em><br> Zorses will attempt to counterattack anyone who attacks them in melee range while being ridden with Retaliation as an Interrupt counterattack, dealing 16d20 damage that inflicts Stun 4 if partial success does not apply. This deals Blunt wounds, and uses its Riders Accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Overrun</strong> <em>(Speed 12)</em><br> After a successful melee attack from its rider (including a Dismounting Attack), the Zorse will likewise attack the same target (or the closest to them, if it can not reach the main target) with a Speed 12 Interrupt attack using your Accuracy -3.</p> <p>When Rampaging, the Zorse gains the following abilities it can utilize on its own initiative, with an Accuracy of 45:</p> <p><strong>Hoof Strike</strong> <em>(Speed 12)</em><br> Deals 16d20 damage and inflicts Blunt wounds.</p> <p><strong>Trample</strong> <em>(Speed 20)</em><br> Deals 18d20 damage and inflicts Blunt wounds. If it hits, its target must make a Stamina 15 roll and if prone, it also inflicts Stun 12.</p> <p><strong>Wildmane</strong> <em>(Speed 14)</em><br> The Zorse expels chakra through its mane, which cuts through the air in an arc toward an opponent. It has a Range of 36, +2 Accuracy, and inflicts Slashing wounds, dealing 24d20 damage. This can not be parried by the Parry action, though ninjutsu-based parries work against it. This is considered a B-rank technique.</p> <h2 id="rank-gear">Rank Gear</h2> <h4 id="genin">Genin</h4> <h5 id="exploding-tag">Exploding Tag</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <p>Rectangular slips of paper inscribed with special seals, centered around the kanji for “explode”. They’re infused with chakra, but normally inert. A tag can be “primed” by focusing a small amount of chakra into them, at which point they can stick to most surfaces (like walls, or the underside of bridges; tags cannot be attached to people) and are ready to be detonated; this doesn’t take an action.</p> <p>Detonating a tag is a Chakra 5, Speed 10, Delay X action which requires you to physically touch the tag in question. X may be set anywhere between 10 and (10 + Chakra Control Ranks), and unlike other techniques, you may reduce this action’s Speed below its Delay, and the Delay itself may not be Aborted. When a tag is on its Delay (or ‘countdown’) it begins sparking, smoking, and sizzling distinctively; any shinobi will realize that it’s about to go off, and if hidden, their location is immediately revealed.</p> <p>Fire will not cause tags to explode, nor will they explode in a “chain reaction”. A tag that is blown up or burnt, even a primed one, is just destroyed, however Tags that have been set to Detonate may not be attacked, and are immune to all damage once they begin their countdown.</p> <p>Tags do 5d20.open(10) damage, in Area 20. If multiple tags are set off on the same IC (and someone is hit by them all), their damage is combined for determining what wounds they inflict; explosions inflict Blunt wounds. When detonated, the explosion can not be defended against, but anyone who escapes their area in time automatically avoids all damage.</p> <p>Certain jutsu may cause tags to explode immediately; in this case, the explosion may be dodged normally, using the attack’s Speed to determine valid defenses and area-of-effect dodge penalties, if any.</p> <h5 id="forehead-protector">Forehead Protector</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: Free</li> <li>Tags: Armor, Consumable</li> </ul> <p>A rectangular piece of metal with your village’s emblem prominently engraved. They’re typically worn on the forehead, but can be strapped to any part of the body. When worn, it blocks the effects of the first Minor wound you receive to the body part worn on (which you should declare when rolling Initiative if not on the forehead), but is knocked off in the process.</p> <h5 id="kusari-katabira">Kusari Katabira</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo per location, or 500 for a full “suit”</li> <li>Tags: Armor, Consumable</li> </ul> <p>A form-fitting metallic mesh, it has overthrown the bulky and, frankly, antiquated armors of old that were typically large, layered plates of metal. Samurai now favor such armor, which for most shinobi is about all you need to say to explain why you shouldn’t. While still encumbering, this more modern style of “fishnet” armor is less intrusive and antithetical to a shinobi’s favored tactics.</p> <p>Due to shinobi fashion being almost as much about personality as it is practicality, designers have made variants of the armor that can fit any combination of parts of the body the user wishes, or simply be made as a “full-body suit”, though they tend to stop a few inches short of the ankles and calves even so, and never are designed to protect the head (don’t ask).</p> <p>Mechanically, this is tracked with only three “locations”: Arms, Legs, and Torso (which includes Torso and Abdomen, for wounding location). Armor worn on any given location is assumed to cover both arms or legs, and when damaged, it’s considered damaged on both locations without having to track wounds for left or right. You can only have one type of armor on a given body location.</p> <p>The first time you would be wounded in any given location sporting this armor, you reduce the wound severity by one (potentially negating it entirely), and lower the total damage taken (after determining if you’re wounded) by 20. The second time, you reduce the wound severity by one, to a minimum of minor, and lower the total damage taken (again, after determining if you’d be wounded) by 10, after which the armor is ‘broken’, and provides no further benefit (but maintains its penalties) until you can get it repaired back at your village.</p> <p>While wearing this armor, you take a -1 to your Athletics, Stealth and Initiative rolls per location covered. It is trivial to remove outside of combat, but inside of combat it is a Speed 10 action to remove it from one location, or a Speed 25 action to remove a full suit.</p> <p>Villages will repair Requisition-acquired damaged armor for free, but frown upon overzealous (or masochistic) shinobi coming in for repairs excessively often, and will thereby only repair any damaged armor once a week (once per OOC day).</p> <h4 id="chuunin">Chuunin</h4> <h5 id="flak-vest">Flak Vest</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 400 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Armor, Consumable</li> </ul> <p>Often referred to as ‘chuunin vests’, these are what many a genin strives to be allowed to wear. There’s a jounin version as well, slightly different in appearance but functionally identical.</p> <p>Any time your torso or abdomen would be wounded, the vest reduces the wound’s severity by 1, and the final damage by 50 (after determining if you’re wounded). The next time, it reduces your final damage taken by 40; then 30, and so forth, until it reaches 0, after which the vest is damaged too badly to provide any protection and no longer reduces the severity of your wounds. You can only have one type of armor on a given body location.</p> <h5 id="custom-smoke-bombs">Custom Smoke Bombs</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: Level*10 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable, Environmental</li> </ul> <p>Once someone’s a chuunin, they have enough pull to get these: smoke bombs designed to your own specifications! Very nice, and such. For pricing, first determine the ‘level’ of smoke bomb you want, which starts at 0 and is modified by…</p> <ul> <li>Visibility Penalty: -4 (+0), -6 (+2), or -8 (+3)</li> <li>Duration: 5 IC (+1), 10 IC (+2), 15 IC (+3), or 20 IC (+5)</li> <li>Radius: 5 yards (+1), 10 yards (+2), or 25 yards (+3)</li> <li>Range: STR/5 yards (+0), STR/4 yards (+1), or STR/3 yards (+2)</li> </ul> <h5 id="exploding-tag-type-2">Exploding Tag, Type 2</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <p>A more powerful version of the regular exploding tags, not given to genin because experience has shown, time and again, that genin really can’t be trusted with high-end explosives. Chuunin, however, are more responsible–at least, in theory.</p> <p>Therefore, they get to play with the big explosions! Type 2 tags function identically to regular exploding tags more regards, though the deal 7d20.open(10) damage and have an Area of 30. Additionally, they deal double damage to inanimate objects (such as walls, but not including jutsu-based defenses).</p> <h4 id="jounin">Jounin</h4> <h5 id="hand-guards">Hand Guards</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Armor, Consumable</li> </ul> <p>Gloves (often fingerless) with a metal plate covering the back of the hand. These allow you to parry weapon attacks unarmed; however, if you do so, any wounds (if you fail) will be applied to your hands (or arms, or whatever, as appropriate for the rank of the wounds).</p> <p>That said, the first two times you’re wounded doing this, the wound’s severity is reduced one rank. The second time that happens, the guard on the back of that glove will be broken. Thus, if you wear both gloves (100 Ryo pays for a pair), you could do it a total of four times. You can only have one type of armor on a given body location.</p> <p>You may also block with these guards, with the same wound location and severity effects. This allows you to block weapons without reducing blocking’s effectiveness.</p> <h5 id="exploding-tag-type-3">Exploding Tag, Type 3</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 500 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Consumable</li> </ul> <p>The end-all and be-all of ‘mundane’ explosives, reserved for jounin simply because of how difficult they are to produce, which is in turn reflected in how troublesome they are to get ahold of.</p> <p>Type 3, like Type 2, deal double damage to inanimate objects. They deal 10d20.open(10) damage, and have an Area of 50, and deal triple damage to inanimate objects (such as Walls, but not including jutsu-based defenses).</p> <h4 id="anbu">ANBU</h4> <h5 id="anbu-mask">ANBU Mask</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Armor</li> </ul> <p>Hand-crafted white ceramic masks featuring mono- or bichromatic lines that make the mask resemble some kind of animal’s face. Technically there’s nothing preventing you from changing what animal it is each time you replace the mask, but most ANBU members stick with a single choice and use it as a distinguishing feature.</p> <p>ANBU masks reduce the severity of head wounds by one rank, a total of three times before being made useless. The mask does crack, break, and fall off during this process. You can only have one type of armor on a given body location.</p> <h5 id="anbu-cloak">ANBU Cloak</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Tags: Armor</li> </ul> <p>High-quality cloaks that wrap around a user’s body to obscure them from the shoulders down. They’re practically waterproof, and do a great job of keeping out the rain. Stains– especially blood! –come right out in the wash!</p> <p>Once per 100 IC you can make an automatic surprise attack with any Small-size weapon, drawing it as a Speed 0 action, as long as you haven’t used that weapon previously in the fight.</p> <p>They come in black (for most ANBU) and white (for captains). Most ANBU captains stick with the black anyway since it looks better. They’re ANBU captains, they do what they want.</p> <h4 id="kage">Kage</h4> <h5 id="kage-hat">Kage Hat</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: Priceless</li> </ul> <p>Every village’s Kage has a distinctive hat to go with their formal Kage’s robes. It’s diamond-shaped with a pointed top, sloping low enough to keep the sun from their eyes and occasionally accompanied by a headdress to obscure the sides of their head. If worn properly, it can also obscure the upper half of their face from view, which looks really cool.</p> <p>The hat is mostly a color corresponding to the country the Kage is from, with a white portion at the front and a kanji indicating their country of origin in the dominant color in that section.</p> <p>While not useful in combat, it is a VERY nice hat.</p> <h5 id="kage-robes">Kage Robes</h5> <ul> <li>Cost: Priceless</li> </ul> <p>Formal attire for Kages, mostly white and off-white, with the lower half (and some highlights on the upper half) being a color corresponding to the village. They look bulky, but they actually breathe very well! The robes are exceptionally comfortable, and while not stylish they tend to swish and swoosh dramatically.</p> <p>The robes impose a -3 penalty on accuracy, dodge rolls, and Athletics checks. However, because Kages are totally badass they can shed these robes as a Speed -2 Interrupt. And yes, that’s a negative sign there.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Anchorsify .
