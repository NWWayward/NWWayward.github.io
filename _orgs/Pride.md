Located in the eastern part of Wind Country, Sunagakure no Sato has a stable, hot climate accented by very cold nights. The village is surrounded by a partial caldera of sandstone and rock on three sides, with a massive stone wall blocking the fourth, allowing one narrow opening into the village. This opening is always guarded by highly trained shinobi, making the village nearly inaccessible. The entire village of Sunagakure is modeled around a giant compass, with main roads reaching out from the village center in all eight directions. Suna buildings are round in shape, and made of red adobe. This allows for sand to blow around the buildings during storms, and for easy, cheap repairs afterward. Because there is no room to expand outward in Suna, they build upward, connecting these adobe skyscrapers with enclosed pathways high above the narrow streets.
