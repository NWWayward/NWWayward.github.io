A collection of Ninshu’s strongest physical development commanded by a single Shogun who ruled over a legion of warriors. They have absolute staying power, and move actual mountains with their strength and numbers. 

## Akimichi (Noble)
It’s hard to say that there were any real ‘Good guys’ in this war unless they were a monk, though one thing about the Akimichi clan is that they fought fair. Typically giving their opponents the chance to attack them, only for them to present a fatal counterattack. They would measure their opposition’s strength by tanking their hits and then steamroll most of the other clans. Though when they found that most of them were desperate and fighting for their survival, the Akimichi took mercy upon them. All except for the Kaguya, which they spared almost none. When asked to join the Pride, the Akimichi were happy to have new comrades. 

**Akimichi begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

#### -=[ Calorie Conversion ]=-
Akimichi can convert excess calories to Chakra, and in fact, it is a well-kept secret within the clan that they *have* to in order to utilize their Clan Jutsu: They are simply too exhausting to be used without them. Overuse of this ability results in them literally eating away at their own body, as once all fat stores have been used, muscles and organ tissue is converted next.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 4
 - Scale: 0
 - Limit: RES/10

Effects: You gain 5 Calorie Points (CP) per rank of this ability taken.  CP can be spent to lower the Chakra cost of any Akimichi clan jutsu on a one-for-one basis, to a minimum of 0.  If you reduce any Jutsu’s Chakra cost to 0, you do not have to roll for it (but make sure you declare the CP is reducing it to 0 for clarity).

You recover RES/5 CP per day, or half that amount if you can’t eat at least two full meals.  You can choose to stop at your normal maximum (5 per rank) or go up to double that value (with 4 ranks, you’d have a normal maximum of 20, and a true maximum of 40). Every 10 CP you are over your normal maximum (round up) applies a -1 to Dodge rolls and Athletics rolls. As you use CP in battle, you adjust these penalties accordingly.

In dire circumstances, you may spend HP (not Vitality) in place of CP.  This may only be done once you have 0 CP remaining, and for every 1 CP you wish to utilize to help pay for a Jutsu, you lose 4 HP.

#### -=[ Akimichi Energy Bars ]=-
Tasty, individually-wrapped energy bars which come in dozens of flavors, including peanut butter, chocolate chip, blackberry, celery, and milk.  They’re packed full of calories and simple carbohydrates, and Akimichi are able to metabolize them almost instantly.

 - Type: Item
 - Cost: 50 Ryo

Effects: You can eat these to gain Calorie Points!  Eating a bar in combat is a Speed 10 action that restores 10+(RES/10) CP.  You may only eat up to RES/25 Energy Bars in a day (any more and they’ll end up making you sick). The CP gained from these Energy Bars can not take you above your normal maximum for CP, based on your ranks of Calorie Conversion.

#### --( Baika no Jutsu - Multi-Size Technique )--
The Akimichi’s signature jutsu, this increases the user’s height and weight drastically; due to the extreme amounts of chakra necessary to cause such immediate growth, it’s usually fueled by the clan’s calorie control techniques.
 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 25 + X * 5
 - Upkeep: X
 - Speed: 8
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: X has a maximum of 5. You gain +Xd* to all Taijutsu, increase (not decrease) the base Speed of all your Taijutsu attacks by X/2 (round down), add (or increase the existing) Area X/2 (round down) to all melee Taijutsu (though if you use a single-target attack it still requires a target, even with the added Area), gain (STR/10)*X DR, and reduce all Knockbacks you suffer by X. Unfortunately, you also gain a -X to all Dodges while in this form, though if you choose to utilize the Take the Hit action, the penalty to Dodge is instead changed to a bonus, and you are allowed to automatically block whenever you successfully Take the Hit.

You can opt to change the value of X as a Speed Y * 2, CP Y * 5 action while you maintain this jutsu, with Y being the difference between its current value and the value you’re changing it to: going from X = 4 to X = 1 would be Speed 6 action costs 15 CP.

#### --( Nikudan Sensha - Human Bullet Tank )--
After enlarging with Baika no Jutsu, the Akimichi tucks their arms and legs close to their body (and usually under their similarly-enlarged clothing) and rolls semi-blindly toward a target to run right into them.  LIKE A WREEECKING BAAALLL.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra:  20 + Special
 - Speed: Variable, Abort
 - Requires: Baika no Jutsu active

Effects: When you use this Jutsu you declare that you are Rolling and for how many IC. You can also declare one other variable speed action (such as Block, or Defensive Formation) to utilize alongside it, which is not ended by any Bowl attacks you make so long as you continue Rolling. Its Chakra Cost is increased by 4 per rank of Power Attack you wish to apply to any of the Bowl attacks you make while Rolling, which doesn't then increase the Stamina cost of Bowl. While Rolling the only non-interrupt action you can take without first Aborrting your Rolling action is Bowl, below, or the Move action, though while you are moving your secondary variable speed action choice (if any) does not apply. You take Baika’s X as a penalty to Taijutsu parries and Awareness rolls, can not use any jutsu with a Seal Speed or hold weapons, and any grapples you are in control of automatically end, but you ignore any Stuns of X or less. 

**--( Bowl )--**  

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank D
 - Stamina: 10 
 - Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack
 - Area: 2
 - Speed: 10

Effects: This attack is modified by Baika no Jutsu, as normal for Taijutsu, and does not end your Rolling action from Human Bullet Tank. If you hit someone with this attack, your IC advances only half as much as it ordinarily would (if you hit someone with a Speed 12 Bowl attack, you’d then only advance your IC by 6), and successive hits of Bowl against the same target(s) multiple times increases your Damage Bonus by 1, consecutively, up to half your normal damage bonus. However, if you miss someone with this attack, you can't target them again with it for double the speed of the Bowl attack you missed with, as you must make wide turns (though you can always elect to target someone else in that time).

#### --( Partial Multi-Size Technique )--
A more exhausting but wieldy version of Baika no Jutsu, this jutsu quickly enlarges only a single part of the Akimichi’s body, usually an arm or leg, in order to enhance a Taijutsu attack’s force and reach and take their opponents by surprise.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 6 + X * 2 + Special
 - Speed: +X
 - Limit: Can not be used with Baika no Jutsu active

Effects: You can add this technique to any other Taijutsu attack you perform; you gain +Xd* to the attack’s damage, add (or increase the existing) Range by X, add a Knockback of X/2, and gain +X/5 Accuracy to the attack and if it's a melee attack, it gains or increases its Area by X/2, rounding down where necessary. The first time this Jutsu is used in combat, it’s treated as a Surprise Attack. X has a maximum of 6. Your limb returns to normal immediately after the attack is resolved.  At least five CP must be spent every time you utilize this jutsu, though it reduces the Chakra cost like normal.

#### --( Nikudan Hari Sensha - Spiked Human Bullet Tank )--
The Akimichi attaches dozens of kunai to multiple lengths of wire which they then drape loosely around their body. When they increase in size the wires become taut, and the kunai form rings of spikes around their body. While this is certainly effective as a means of attack, the real purpose is much simpler: the kunai function like cleats, aiding in turning.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 30 + Special
 - Speed: Variable, Abort
 - Requires: Baika no Jutsu active

Effects: This jutsu functions in all the same ways as described in Nikudan Sensha, except that your Bowl attack is now Stamina 15 and considered to be a weapon attack, meaning Blocking reduces it by less, and it may be harder to parry, and you can take and apply Weapon Focus to it, as well as Power Attack, with both abilities normal Stamina increase instead applying to its Chakra cost, at double the normal cost. For every point your attack hits by you add +1d* to the attack’s damage, though if they block or elect to not defend they do not take any addition damage, and anyone who attempts to attack you in melee range while you’re Rolling takes half Bowl's damage, with no Speed or Damage Bonus added to it, which can not wound.  They can choose to opt out of their attack to avoid the damage, but otherwise get no defense against it if they continue with their attack. Thanks to the Kunai, the delay in how quickly you can turn to target someone is made easier, negating the delay before you can retarget someone after missing them with Bowl.

Using this Jutsu requires at least 30 Kunai attached by wire, which are not used up and may be used repeatedly for this technique, though repurposing them as throwing weapons (i.e., removing them from their wire) means they can not longer be used for this until reattached (as something to be done out of combat).

#### -=[ Cho Baika no Jutsu - Super Multi-Size Technique ]=-
Essentially an even larger version of Baika no Jutsu, the Akimichi increases to gigantic proportions, at a minimum as tall as a two-story building, and potentially up to several times that amount.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 25
 - Limit: 1
 - Requires: 100 CHA

Effects: Baika no Jutsu’s X maximum is increased to 10.  When X is higher than 5, the following changes also apply:

 -  You can not Hide; if Hidden when you perform Baika, you are automatically revealed.
 -  You may choose to automatically block any attack of C-rank or lower as a Speed 0 Interrupt; in essence, your size alone has most blows glancing off of you.  You can always do so against Basic Attacks.
 -  You gain +X to your PDB-based Grapple rolls.
 -  All Taijutsu increase their range by X.
 -  You increase the die size of all Taijutsu by one step ( d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12 ), to a maximum of d12; Taijutsu already at d12 instead gain +2 damage per die rolled.

#### --( Cho Harite - Mega Palm Thrust )--
Usable only when already enlarged by Baika no Jutsu, the Akimichi tend to perform this jutsu sparingly because of how tiring it is, but there’s no denying the efficacy of reinforcing a person-sized palm with more Chakra to turn it hard as steel in order to flatten your opponent in the hand-sized crater left behind in the ground.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 60 + Special
 - Speed: +6
 - Special: Requires Baika no Jutsu active at X = 6 or more.

Effects: You can add this Jutsu to any other Unarmed Taijutsu attack you perform except for Nikudan Sensha or Nikudan Hari Sensha, and any jutsu which specify they are kicks. You double all of the bonuses that Baika no Jutsu grants for that attack, including the Taijutsu die size increase, which can increase d12's to d20's (as one step), gaining the +2 damage per die thereafter if it would increase again. At least ten CP must be spent every time you utilize this jutsu, though they reduce the Chakra cost like normal.

#### -=[ Sanshoku no Gan'yaku - Three-Colored Pills ]=-
A secret medicine developed and used exclusively by the Akimichi clan, these three pills convert stored energy into chakra to give the user a tremendous boost in power.  Understandably, these are exceptionally potent in the hands of an Akimichi.
Even so, there’s a good reason they’re not widely used: They’re not gentle on the body, and are exceedingly toxic.  Despite their names, they don’t taste like food.  They taste like, well—Poison.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 50
 - Limit: 1

Effects: You gain access to three different, Akimichi-exclusive Pills, detailed below, gaining one of each Pill.  Eating a Pill is a Speed 8 action.  All Pills operate the same way: When you take a pill, you will gain some amount of Calorie Points, some amount of Stats, and are Poisoned for a certain number of IC.  The amount of CP you gain is based on your true maximum (10 per rank of Calorie Conversion), but can not take you above it.  While under the effects of the pills, you suffer no penalties of having too many CP, but when a pill’s effects end, you lose CP equal to how many it gave you, and must spend your own Hit Points to bring yourself up to 0 if you go into a negative amount, losing 2 HP per CP you’re short. This can take you into the negative of HP, and can be fatal.  While using any of the Pills, you can not access Natural Chakra or open any Gates, and any NC you had or any Gates that were opened when you take a Pill are lost, or closed, as appropriate.

When under the effect of any pill, or when a pill’s effects expire, you can take a higher-strength pill as a Speed 8 Interrupt. If you use one while another is in effect (for example, you take the Green pill, and 20 IC later you take the Yellow pill) you overwrite all the effects (including the Poison) of the lower-strength pill, but you lose only the higher pill’s CP allotment when it’s full Duration expires and suffer Fatigue levels only when your new Pill’s effects (i.e., Poison) ends, meaning you only suffer the penalties of the highest, and most recent, Pill you have taken.

As you may notice, it’s quite possible to go above “Fatigue 6”, which is to say, unconscious, by using these pills.  Pushing your body to such extremes is dangerous, and hard to recover from: For every Fatigue level you are beyond unconscious (i.e., Fatigue 8 would be 2 over the normal maximum), each Fatigue level takes an entire in-game week to heal.  For example, if you were at Fatigue 9, you would be 3 levels above and beyond unconscious.  This means that once you wake up, it would take a week to recover from Fatigue 5, another week to recover from Fatigue 4, and a third week to recover from Fatigue 3.  While still recovering in this delayed manner, you cannot regain any Calorie Points or receive the benefits of the Pills (they’re still poison, though) until you’ve begun to recover your Fatigue at the normal rate.

Akimichi are issued only one of each pill at a time.  Anyone other than an Akimichi who takes one of the pills suffers the Poison effect, and receives none of the benefits.  Giving these pills away is treason, and it’s a credit to the clan that to date no Akimichi has done so.

###### --( Hourengan - Green Spinach Pill )--
You gain half your normal maximum Calorie Points, and your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0.  For the pill’s duration, you gain +5 to all stats.

 - Duration: 50
 - Poison: 4
 - Special: When the Pill's duration expires, your Fatigue level is increased by 2.

###### --( Karengan - Yellow Curry Pill )--
You gain half your true maximum Calorie Points, and your Stamina penalty is reset to 0. For the pill’s duration, you gain +10 to all stats.

 - Duration: 75
 - Poison: 6
 - Special: When the Pill’s duration expires, your Fatigue level is increased by 4.

###### --( Red Chili Pill )--
You gain your full true maximum’s worth of CP, and your Fatigue level is reduced by 1.  For the Pill’s duration, you gain +15 to all stats, and you gain access to a special jutsu, detailed below.

 - Duration: 100
 - Poison: 8
 - Special: When the Pill’s duration expires, your Fatigue level is increased by 6.

###### --( Chodan Bakugeki - Butterfly Bullet Bomb )--
This technique is only usable after an Akimichi has consumed a Red Chili Pill, due to its extreme chakra requirements; in fact, that's where it got its name. The amount of chakra produced from consuming it is so excessive that the Akimichi's body has to vent it off, resulting in visible plumes of chakra bursting from their shoulder blades in a display reminiscent of butterfly wings.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 150 + Special
 - Damage: (STR/4)d12
 - Speed: 20
 - Area: PDB * 3
 - Requires: Red Chili Pill eaten
 - Special: You do not need to learn this jutsu; it is usable as long as you meets its requirement

Effects: You gain double your normal Physical Damage Bonus to this attack. Your target takes full damage, and anyone else in its area takes half damage. You must use at least 50 CP each time you perform this attack; if you don’t have enough CP, you can’t use it.

## Henzaki (Noble)
The Immortals, and one of the original founding clans of The Pride. A unique evolution of Ninshu in their blood made their bloodline most impregnable by most offenses. The Henzaki clan found that it was other bloodlines that had most to lose and seeing that they were the most likely to survive the war, brought it upon themselves to be the solution rather than the cause. They found what allies they could and formed the Pride to save as many warriors of Ninshu as they could.

#### --( Homeostasis )--  
Henzaki physiology has an incredible ability to adapt, responding to any changes in its environment or condition, every system function of their body reacting instantly with a single goal: maintaining the stability of their vital functions.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Scale: 0
 - Limit: RES/40

Effects: You reduce the severity of any Poison you’re afflicted with by 1 per Rank, and take damage from Poison every 2 IC, rather than every IC. If the Poison’s Severity is reduced to half or less from this ability, all secondary effects of the Poison are negated.

Anytime you are given a Bleed status, you immediately take damage from it and reduce it (instead of doing so 5 and 20 IC later, respectively); a dramatic, grotesque spray of blood is optional to indicate this. Thereafter, you take damage from the Bleed status every 10 IC, rather than every 5, and reduce your Bleed statuses every 10 IC (rather than 20). Bleeding from sources other than the Bleed status is halved, and has its duration halved; if it does not have a set duration, it stops after 100 IC.

Suffocation effects do not force you to make Stamina rolls, but still apply normally. Even if you’re killed, you won’t truly ‘die’ until reduced to -200% HP; you’ll seem dead, all vital signs stopped, but will revive once you return to 1 HP.

#### --( Regeneration )--
Among those who’ve worked alongside Henzaki for any prolonged period of time, this is probably their most envied ability. A henzaki will heal in minutes from injures that take others hours to get over, and in hours will have recovered from wounds that might take days for ordinary people to recover from.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 4
 - Scale: 4
 - Limit: 1 + RES/40

Effects: You regenerate 1 point of Vitality per Rank each Initiative Count, and twice that amount of HP.  In a given day, you can only heal (Rank) times your maximums of each: Thus, at two ranks in this ability, if you had 1000 Vitality you could only regenerate 2000 Vitality in a given day.
Additionally, for every Rank in this ability you have, pick a Wound category (Blunt, Piercing, Slashing, or Energy): You divide the total healing time necessary to recover from any Wound in that category by 1+(0.5*Rank), and may utilize Organ Mobility for Wounds of that category.  Medical attention can not reduce it further; however, you can recover as if you had medical attention, even if you do not, thanks to your regeneration.

#### --( Organ Mobility )--  
The secret to much of the Henzaki’s longevity, and their nigh-immortality, is their ability to control their body’s internal structure. If an organ has been punctured, they can force the wound shut or use another organ to put pressure on it.  If a cavity in their body is hemorrhaging, they can force the lining to open and let it bleed out to relieve pressure.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 10 + X * 5
 - Speed: 6 + X * 2 or +6 + X * 2

Effects: You ignore any one wound you’re currently suffering from, so long as your Regeneration ability allows it.  The wound doesn’t actually heal, but your body adapts in some fashion to function despite it.  This lasts for 24 hours, -6 per severity the wound is above Minor.

You may alternatively elect to use this as an Interrupt in response to being wounded, and by spending a Willpower (in addition to the normal Chakra cost), you can negate the Wound entirely--you simply don’t suffer it, don’t have to recover from it, and so forth.

X is 1 for Minor, 2 for Major, 3 for Severe, and 4 for Critical Wounds.

#### --( Sanguine Vitality )--  
As a result of their bloodline, Henzaki blood itself has a number of interesting, medically significant properties.  Most relevant to shinobi, it can be rapidly metabolized by virtually anyone, and will induce temporary, rapid regeneration.  It still tastes like blood, and since it has to be consumed fresh from the veins to be effective, it’s not a particularly appetizing product.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: 1 + RES/30

Effects: This requires you to be in melee range of someone, and still enough for the recipient to drink your fresh blood. Generally speaking, the Henzaki will cut open their palm or arm and suspend their regeneration for this to work, but simply biting them will suffice.

By suspending all the benefits of your Regeneration ability and allowing someone to drink your blood, you can give up 1 point of HP (not Vitality) per Rank every 5 IC which pass.  Each point of HP restores 5 points of Vitality (not HP) to the recipient. A person cannot die while receiving blood from you.

However, if either you or the recipient moves (or is forcibly moved), or takes any other action, this effect is broken.

## Inuzuka 
Although the Inuzuka struggled against the more defensive clans, they were experts at chasing down enemies trying to flee on horseback. With their own mounts, that weren’t as fast as Horses, but didn’t throw them off, they were the masters of hit and run tactics.

The clan also had much respect for the Akimichi clan, and eventually, the two of them were able to come to an agreement to stop the ever progressing threat of the aggressive Kaguya clan. The Inuzuka remained neutral in most affairs for the longest time until The Pride was formed.

#### --( Shikyaku no Jutsu – Four Legs Technique )--
This technique is the signature fighting style of the Inuzuka, wherein they hunch down on all fours and bare their teeth.  The more experienced the Inuzuka is with this technique, the more bestial they become, with some having elongated canines that become true fangs, spontaneously growing claws, and pupils that narrow and become slitted rather than rounded.  Most impressively, the user’s reflexes, senses, and speed increase noticeably.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 12
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Speed: 10
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: Your movement speed is increased by 10% and your current and maximum Rank in Enhanced Hearing and Blind Fighting abilities are increased by 1. Every time you damage someone with a Taijutsu attack while maintaining this technique, you temporarily shred any sort of DR they might have, reducing their DR (after the damage is resolved) by (3+AGI/30). Shredded DR can not be reduced below 0, and is restored at a rate of 1 per IC.  However, due to being on all fours and your hands becoming more animalistic, all Seal Speeds are increased by 3.

#### --( Tsuga – Passing Fang )--
The Inuzuka launches themselves forward toward an opponent while spinning at such rapid speeds that they almost appear to become an elongated vortex pointed toward their enemy.  It can be extremely damaging if an opponent is caught unaware, as the rotation involved allows the Inuzuka to tear right through most defenses.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank D
 - Stamina: 16
 - Damage: (STR/10)d6 + Special
 - Range: AGI/10 + Special
 - Speed: 12
 - Special: Sudden Attack can not be used with this attack
 - Tags: Slashing

Effects: This technique’s Range is increased by how far you could move during the attack: That is, you always travel the maximum distance possible, though your target can be anywhere within that range to be a valid target for Tsuga.  Movement speed increases (such as Shikyaku) modify this like normal to increase its total range. Despite the listed range, however, Tsuga is considered a melee attack, not a ranged attack.

This technique gains Accuracy, and loses damage, according to how close you are to your target when you attack: For every 20% of the listed Range you are within to your target (after calculating the final Range for this technique), you gain +1 Accuracy, but deal 5% less damage. (i.e., if you had a final Range of 30, and attacked someone with Tsuga who was 22 yards from you, they are below 80% of the technique’s maximum range, and thus you’d get +1 Acc and deal 95% normal damage; if you attacked someone within 6 yards of you with Tsuga with the same total Range, you’d gain +5 Acc but deal 25% less damage).

You apply only one-fourth of your PDB to this technique’s damage, however, you roll damage an additional time for every 3 points by which your Accuracy beats their Defense, to a maximum of three damage rolls if you beat their Defense by 6 or more.  If someone elects to perform a defense which does not have a roll (such as Block, or using Earth Shore Return), or chooses not to defend, you perform the maximum amount of damage rolls.  Each damage roll reduces Block’s effectiveness by 10% (Block would only reduce the damage by 40% on the second damage roll, and by 30% on the third damage roll).  Partial Success does not apply to this attack, and you combine all damage rolls to determine any Wounds inflicted (and likewise, things which add to Wounding are applied only once, to the combined total).

For every time you and/or your Ninken utilize Tsuga consecutively (even if it misses!), its Speed and Stamina cost are reduced by 1, to a minimum of half their normal values. These benefits reset if you take any non-interrupt action besides Move, Tsuga, or Gatsuga, or if you go 20 IC or more without you or your ninken using Gatsuga or this technique.

#### --( Jujin Bunshin – Beast Human Clone )--
Derived from the basic Henge, this technique transforms the ninken into the likeness of its owner, though the ninken will still behave like an animal in this form. However, together with the Shikyaku no Jutsu, the two become virtually indistinguishable.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 16
 - Upkeep: 3
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 6
 - Requires: Shikyaku no Jutsu active

Effects: This technique changes your ninken into an exact look alike of you. By default, you are considered Hidden Among Clones when you activate it, and while this jutsu is maintained you can perform the Hide Among Clones action listed under Bunshin (and your opponents can take the Observe action to distinguish you from your ninken, as well). 

Anytime your Ninken is struck by an attack because of the clone miss chance it gives (to be hit instead of you), compare the damage it takes to your own wounding thresholds: If it would be enough to wound you, your Ninken suffers a Stun equal to 10 * Severity (Minor = 1, Major = 2, etc).  Unlike regular Henge, which is broken upon taking damage, this technique is broken only when the ninken suffers a Stun of severity 20 or higher.

While your ninken remains transformed, they can perform the Tsuga jutsu on their own, and cooperate with you to perform Gatsuga.

#### --( Gatsuga – Fang Passing Fang )--
Tsuga twice over.  Both the Inuzuka and their transformed Ninken coordinate their movements to attack an enemy from multiple sides with Tsuga, to exploit any blindspot the opponent might have—or to make one, if needed, by forcing them to deal with two attacks coming in simultaneously.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank C
 - Stamina: 24
 - Damage: (STR/10)d8 + Special
 - Range: AGI/8 + Special
 - Speed: 16
 - Requires: Jujin Bunshin active, 8 AP to pay for your Ninken’s attack
 - Special: Sudden Attack can not be used with this attack
 - Tags: Slashing

Effects: This attack has two accuracies your target must defend against: One which you roll (as 1d20+Accuracy bonuses), and the other being your regular Taijutsu Accuracy TN.  The higher of the two becomes the Accuracy that determines if your technique hits (and how many times it hits), while the lower increases this technique’s damage by +1d6 per point it beats your opponent’s Defense by, if any, to a maximum of an additional (STR/10)d6.

This jutsu functions otherwise like Tsuga for how you determine your movement (and how you must move the technique’s full Range), and any bonuses from consecutive uses of Tsuga apply to Gatsuga as well (and vice versa), and accordingly how you determine your bonus (if any) to Accuracy and penalty to Damage based on how far you are from your target. Like Tsuga, Partial Success does not apply to this attack, and you combine its damage rolls to determine what, if any, Wounds are inflicted, as well as increased Wounding benefits.

Gatsuga’s damage differs, however: You apply only one-fifth of your PDB to its damage, but roll damage an additional time for every two points you beat your opponent’s defense by, to a maximum of five damage rolls if you beat their Defense by 8. Like Tsuga, if your opponent elects to Defend in a way that does not have them roll, you make the maximum amount of damage rolls (but gain no extra d6’s from beating their defensive roll), and Block reduces this technique’s damage 5% less per damage roll (40% for the second, 30% for the third, etc).

#### --( Inuzuka-Ryu: Jinju Konbi Henge: Sotoro – Inuzuka-Style: Human Beast Combination Technique: Double-Headed Wolf )--
This fearsome transformation technique combines shinobi and ninken into a massive two-headed version of their Ninken. While being in this form has its obvious benefits, this technique is most valued as an essential preparation for the Inuzuka's most devastating form of Tsuga.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 32
 - Upkeep: 10
 - Speed: 16

Effects: Your Ninken combines with you and may no longer take separate actions. You gain +3 to Accuracy, d20 rolls, PDB, and Stamina, and can use either your’s or the Ninken’s Awareness, Survival or Stealth whenever a roll is required, whichever is preferrable.

Your movement speed is increased by 25% and your current and maximum Rank in Enhanced Hearing and Blind Fighting abilities are increased by 4 while you maintain this jutsu, and every time you damage someone with a Taijutsu attack in this form, you temporarily shred any sort of DR they might have, reducing their DR (after the damage is resolved) by 7; their DR recovers at a rate of 1 per IC naturally.

While you maintain this form, you can not perform handseals, hold weapons, or Hide (because you are a huge, multi-headed beast).  This technique automatically ends Shikyaku no Jutsu and Beast Human Clone if they were active when this technique was performed, and you can not activate either jutsu while you maintain this one. If you take a Major or higher Severity Wound, this jutsu automatically ends as you are forcibly separated from your Ninken, and you both suffer a Stun 5 * Severity of the Wound.

#### --( Garouga – Fang Wolf Fang )--
Tsuga, but in Sotoro form, where an Inuzuka’s speed (and tail!) can be used to devastating effect to create a truly deadly vortex of claws and teeth to tear apart whomever they come into contact with. The downside to this technique is that the Inuzuka is spinning so rapidly that they can potentially lose sight of their target, and rely upon their enhanced sense of smell to guide them.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank B
 - Stamina: 36
 - Damage: (STR/10)d12
 - Range: AGI/5 + Special
 - Speed: 20
 - Requires: Inuzuka-Ryu: Jinju Konbi Henge: Sotoro be active
 - Special: Sudden Attack can not be used with this attack
 - Tags: Slashing

Effects: When you use this attack, first make an opposed roll of your Survival vs their Stealth: If you succeed, you gain +1d12 damage per point you beat their Stealth by, to a maximum of (STR/10)d12 extra dice.  If they succeed, they get +1 to their defensive roll per point they succeeded by (minimum 1, on a tie).

This attack functions otherwise like Tsuga for how you determine your movement (and how you must move the technique’s full Range), and accordingly how you determine your bonus (if any) to Accuracy and penalty to Damage based on how far you are from your target. 

Garouga’s damage differs, however: You apply only one-fifth of your PDB to its damage, but roll damage an additional time for every point you beat your opponent’s defense by, to a maximum of ten damage rolls if you beat their Defense by 10. Like Tsuga, if your opponent elects to Defend in a way that does not have them roll, you make the maximum amount of damage rolls (but gain no extra damage from the opposed Skill roll), and Block reduces this technique’s damage 5% less per damage roll (45% for the second, 40% for the third, etc).  Partial Success does not apply to this attack, and for Wounding purposes, you add up the damage you inflicted to them from all rolls to determine wounds, and deal three wounds (one Piercing, one Blunt, one Slashing) to them of one severity lower than normal, to a minimum of Minor.

#### -=[ Ninken ]=-
Your ninken, or ninja dog (though some have wolves), is more than just an extra weapon in combat: it’s a living creature with its own capabilities.  However, a ninken is only as good as its master, so its advancement is inextricably linked to yours: Your Ninken’s bonuses are determined by your XP.

Your Ninken has the following Skills of its own:
 - Awareness: 5 + XP/300
 - Stealth: 5 + XP/400
 - Survival: 5 + XP/200

In other words, your ninken begins with Awareness, Stealth, and Survival at Rank 5, and gains +1 Rank in Awareness for every 300 XP you have, +1 in Stealth for every 400 XP you have, and +1 Survival for every 200 XP you have.

If you and your dog are travelling together, you may have your ninken roll a skill check alongside your own roll. This can only be done with skills the Ninken has Ranks in, and does not apply in combat.

#### -=[ Pack Tactics ]=-
When fighting with you, your Ninken acts on every increment of 20 (on IC 20, 40, 60, etc). It uses your attributes, and can do one of several things:

 - *Basic Attack (Speed 10)* – This deals (STR/6)d6, uses half your PDB, and Shreds 10 DR. DR reduced this way returns at a rate of 1 per IC (stacking as one 'status' with your own Shred). Attacking from Stealth increases the damage to use your full PDB.
 - *Grab* – As per the E-Rank Grapple.
 - *Stealth* – Your Ninken can attempt to hide, following normal rules for doing so (which usually means it needs your help to provide a suitable Visibility Penalty to do so).
 - *Search* – Your Ninken can search for you! In actual terms, your Ninken performs both the Search and Observe action (from Bunshin) at the same time, and can use the Point Out action as a Speed 0 Interrupt if it finds anyone, by barking until you see what the Ninken does.  It uses its Awareness roll for this.
 
When using Jujin Bunshin, it can also perform Tsuga, though to do so requires you spend 8 AP.  You can spend additional AP to reduce Tsuga’s speed for the Ninken’s attack, if you wish.  When performing Tsuga, the Ninken Shreds (2+AGI/30) DR every time they damage someone.

Your Ninken does not need to dodge, and cannot be targeted or caught in an AoE.  When an Inuzuka is dealt a Wound, the Ninken freezes and takes a Stun 10 per Severity of the wound (Stun 10 for Minor, Stun 20 for Major, etc), during which time the Ninken can not take actions (losing its chance to act if Stunned on an IC increment of 20, and preventing you from performing Gatsuga). The Severity is considered one tier higher from an Area of Effect attack (so a Minor Wound from an AoE is a Stun 20 on the Ninken).  A Critical Wound from an AoE attack will knock out the Ninken for the duration of the combat.

When fighting alone, your Ninken acts on its own Initiative, using your stats as detailed above, though it has a -6 to its Dodge and if it’s hit once, it’s knocked out.

#### -=[ Ninken Abilities ]=-
These are ways you can train your Ninken to excel!  Your Ninken gains one from the list below for every 500 XP you have; you may not take an ability more than once unless the Ability says so.

 - *Good Nose*: Your Ninken gains +3 Ranks in Survival, and +1 Rank in Awareness. This can be taken up to 5 times.
 - *Sneaky*: Your Ninken gains +3 Ranks in Stealth, and +1 Rank in Survival. This can be taken up to 5 times.
 - *Swift*: Your Ninken gains +3 Dodge when it’s on its own. This can be taken up to 3 times.
 - *Vicious*: Your Ninken’s Basic Attack becomes d8’s. Taken a second time, it increases to d10’s.
 - *Well-Trained*: Your Ninken gains +1 Rank in Awareness, Stealth, and Survival. You may take this up to 5 times.

## Kaguya
Being the close descendants of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, the Kaguya clan, once again, was dealt a very bad hand. Aggressive nomadic conquerors that they are, the Kaguya was responsible for erasing weaker clans. It was actually because of the Kaguya that The Pride was formed by several clans that saw them as a threat to theres, so in that respect, the Kaguya actually brought a lot of the clans that survived the war together. What’s worse is that the Temperance formed, The Pride formed, and the Sun and Moon Clan were already pushing them back with their strange Ninshu. When backed into a corner, the Kaguya clan divided. A large group of them that sought to preserve their legacy surrendered to The Pride. Another saw the irony and decided to keep their Pride to themselves. Legacy Kaguya and Pride Kaguya HATE eachother, and a Legacy Kaguya would give anything to kill a traitor.

**Kaguya begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

#### --( Shitaikotsu Rensa - Corpse Bone Chain )--
Much like Kaguya themselves in battle, their bloodline seems to grow stronger over time, with no apparent upward limit. That a Kaguya’s power grows exponentially when compared to that of their peers is one of the factors that makes them so valuable to Mist--and so carefully watched.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 5
 - Scale: 0
 - Limit: Maximum Willpower

Effects: Whenever you acquire a Skeletal Modification, from any source other than Corpse Bone Chain, you may increase your Stamina penalty by 2 and gain any other Skeletal Modification (which does not have to be one that technique could normally provide). This may be used a number of times per battle equal to your Rank in this ability. 

#### --( Teshi Sendan - Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets )--
You fire the bones of your fingertips at opponents.  They fly faster than most weapons, and rotate quickly enough to literally drill through most defenses before losing their momentum.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 10 + X * 2
 - Damage: (RES/10 + X)d10
 - Accuracy: +2
 - Range: 10 + RES/10
 - Speed: 10
 - Skeletal Modifications: Osteogenesis
 - Tags: Piercing

Effects: You fire X projectiles, up to a maximum of RES/10 or 10, whichever is lower; your damage bonus for this attack is increased by 0.25 per projectile.  This attack deals Piercing damage and Ignores Armor. For the purposes of defending against this technique it is considered a multi-throw, though it is not subject to other multi-throw rules.

This technique’s damage is increased by X*5% for the purposes of dealing wounds. It uses its actual Speed, or X, to determine damage, whichever is higher. Any defenses with a set amount of HP (such as Earth Shore Return) take double damage from Teshi Sendan.

You may take Weapon Focus: Teshi Sendan, which increases its Chakra Cost appropriately.

#### --( Tsubaki no Mai - Dance of the Camellia )--
By manipulating their skeleton, Kaguya are able to extrude weapons made of bone through their flesh, pulling them out the rest of the way and using them in combat. Despite being bones, they are stronger than iron.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 15
 - Speed: 10
 - Skeletal Modifications: Blades, Spurs, Osteogenesis, Realignment

Effects: You can create any non-Large weapon from the Equipment section of the PHB, other than bows (arrows are fine). If you wish, you may ‘draw’ these weapons as part of this technique, discard them, or keep them partially extended from your skeleton, ready to be ‘drawn’ whenever you wish. If you are creating a weapon with the ‘Dual’ property, you can create two of them with only one use of this technique, though doing so increases its Chakra cost by 5.

In the hands of anyone but a Kaguya these have a -3 Accuracy penalty. Your own bone weapons have a +2 bonus to their Accuracy when you are using them. Other Kaguya using your weapons receive no penalty or bonus. Though they will safely last the entirety of any combat, outside of it they last five minutes before becoming brittle and unusable.

#### --( Karamatsu no Mai - Dance of the Larch )--
This technique creates razor-sharp bone spikes all over the user’s body, branching off from the existing skeletal structure. These bones can stop attacks on their own, or if necessary the user can spin in place, turning themselves and the area around them into a veritable death trap.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 18
 - Speed: 8
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Skeletal Modifications: Blades, Spurs
 - Tags: Slashing or Piercing

Effects: This is a melee-range parry with a +1 bonus per Rank of Bone Spurs you have active. If successful, the attacker also takes damage from your Spurs as if they had struck you, plus your Physical Damage Bonus multiplied by the Speed you used this technique at.

#### --( Yanagi no Mai - Dance of the Willow )--
A multitude of bones protrude from the Kaguya’s body, most commonly along the shoulders, elbows and knees, creating sharp spikes that extend outward in several directions, turning their entire body into a weapon. Thereafter, the user can focus on evasion and counter attacking, with minimal movement required to strike at anyone who comes near.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 25
 - Upkeep: 4
 - Damage: (RES/10)d4
 - Speed: 6
 - Skeletal Modifications: Armor, Blades, Spurs, Realignment
 - Tags: Slashing or Piercing, Preparation

Effects: While maintaining this technique, as a Speed 0 action you may spend 4 AP to attack anyone in melee range using your bones.  By raising the cost to 6 AP you can target everyone in melee range.  You may attack with Dance of the Willow at most once every 10 IC, and the first time in battle you do so, it is considered a surprise attack.

This is treated as a Speed 8 attack, though it does not allow you to move as part of the attack; you do not increase your IC because of this but that Speed is used to determine viable defenses and the attack’s damage. You can spend additional AP to lower the effective Speed further. Parrying this attack reduces its damage by half and prevents it from inflicting wounds, rather than defending against it fully.

You acquire a Skeletal Modification every time you spend AP to attack with Dance of the Willow, but not when you first use the technique and pay its Chakra cost.

#### --( Tessenka no Mai - Dance of the Clematis )--
Through the use of Shikotsumyaku, the Kaguya creates a bone weapon from one of the central bones of the body (typically the femur or the spine), which is then augmented further. The resulting weapon is both stronger and lighter than any metal, making it positively devastating in the hands of a skilled Kaguya.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 35
 - Speed: 16
 - Skeletal Modifications: Any

Effects: This creates a Large, Piercing, Slashing Weapon, which can use both Sword and Polearm abilities and techniques. Attacking is a Stamina 25, Speed 16 action.  It deals 1d12 damage per Skeletal Modification you have when you create it, and you may take the Weapon Focus ability for this weapon. The weapon lasts the entirety of the combat it's made in, but only lasts an hour once the combat is over, after which it begins to deteriorate and is no longer usable. Anyone else but you (including other Kaguya) who use the weapoon use its base statistics, listed above, but for each rank you have in certain Skeletal Modifications, its statistics are modified when you (and only you) use it:

 - Armor: -1 base Speed
 - Blades: +5% Wounds
 - Spurs: +1 Accuracy
 - Osteogenesis: -2 Stamina cost

#### --( Sawarabi no Mai - Dance of the Seedling Fern )--
The pinnacle of the Kaguya clan’s techniques, this creates a countless number of bone spires around the user, creating an entire field made from their bones which they can shape as they desire. The field entraps and potentially skewers everyone caught in it, and the Kaguya can instantly travel from one bone to another by melding in and out of them.

 - Type: Taijutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 40
 - Damage: 1d12 per Skeletal Modification
 - Area: PDB * 2 Yards
 - Speed: 25
 - Skeletal Modifications: Any two
 - Tags: Environmental, Point Blank Area of Effect

Effects: Even if someone dodges this technique, they do not escape its area; they simply avoid being skewered by the bone spires erupting from the ground. 

You may move anywhere in the field as a Speed 0 action (though you can't take anyone else with you when you do this, and thus couldn't do it while grappled); As a Speed +4 link to any non-interrupt attack, you can make it a Surprise Attack. By melding into and out of the bones you can remove any Immobilization penalties from effects which restrain or cage you (so not those from poison, genjutsu, etc.) as a Speed 4 action.  While inside your bone field, you may attempt to Hide; when you Hide, you begin at Stealth 2.

If someone attempts to escape the bone field, and you are aware of them (i.e., they are not Hidden from you), you may  Interrupt their action with any melee-range attack of Speed 10 or less by moving to them and attacking.  If you hit, your attack knocks them back RES/10 yards toward the center, and stops any further movement they would have had from their action.

When used, this technique destroys all Ground effects in its area (such as mud on the ground).  Inside the field, the Kaguya has a +5 to Awareness. If this technique is used again when already inside its area, the two fields overlap and combine; nobody already in the field will be damaged again; and the cost is halved, after applying Osteogenesis’ reduction.

After a few hours the bones will grow brittle as the chakra dissipates, beginning to crumble. Within a day there will be nothing left but dust and bone chips.

###### -=[ Skeletal Modifications ]=-
As the Kaguya fight, their skeletal structure becomes increasingly better-adapted for combat. Every time you use one of your clan jutsu in combat, you gain one of the following modifications. You can apply them repeatedly, their effects stacking additively.

Additionally, every time you suffer a Wound you gain a Skeletal Modification of your choice.

If you wish, you may suppress activation of these modifications. Suppressing any or all of your skeletal modifications is a Speed 0 action. Regardless, once combat has ended these effects all fade within an hour; bones retract into your body, and so forth.

**[ Armor ]** - You extend your bones to cover vital regions, forming broad, flexible plates.  This gives you (RES)/5 Damage Reduction, and can be applied up to 5 times.

**[ Blades ]** - Numerous spikes and blades of hardened bone protrude from your body in combat-useful ways, such as from your knees, extending past your hands, and so forth. This increases your damage bonus by 0.25 for unarmed attacks and weapons created by Dance of the Camellia, or 0.5 for clan jutsu (including Dance of the Clematis’ weapon), each time it’s applied.  This has no limit.

**[ Osteogenesis ]** - The more a Kaguya fights, the easier it becomes for them to do so. Every application of this modification reduces the Chakra costs of clan jutsu by 2. You can apply this up to 5 times.

**[ Realignment ]** - You can recover from any Wound, by investing a number of Skeletal Modifications equal to the Wound's severity: 1 for Minor, 2 for Major, 3 for Severe, 4 for Critical. This does mean that you can choose to immediately recover from any Minor wound you receive by spending the Skeletal Modification you gained from being Wounded on Realignment. Recovering from Wounds above Minor requires you to spend Skeletal Modifications (from the other four types of Armor, Blades, Spurs, or Osteogenesis), which can be from any category, but must be from the same category. You can not 'save up' Realignment mods for later use. In the case of Gates, you can not recover from Wounds received by them until all Gates are closed, though you can recover from Wounds gained from other sources while they are open.

**[ Spurs ]** - Small shards and lengthier spikes of bone gradually cover your body, protruding from beneath your skin and injuring anyone foolish enough to strike you. Anyone who attacks you in melee range takes (your RES)/5 damage if they hit, which can not wound. This damage is also dealt anytime someone uses a Grapple jutsu against you. You can apply this up to 5 times.

## Kairaishi
Of course, while there were sword smiths, there were also armourers. Skilled carpenters and craftsmen that had the idea of ‘Wait a second, what if the armor fought itself?’ But originally, it wasn’t that simple. The Kairaishi’s story begins far before that, when they were simply a nomadic tribe that made these warriors as tools to construct their settlements and harvest their crops. It wasn’t until they had to defend themselves that they were designed to be weapons. In the beginning, it was seen as sacrilege and now it’s just required. The Kairaishi joined the pride so that perhaps one day their weapons would only need to be tools once more.

**Kairaishi begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

#### --( Kugutsu Henge no Jutsu - Puppet Transformation Technique )--
With this technique, a Kairaishi can channel their chakra through one of their puppets to give it their own appearance. This is typically done in conjunction with a self-henge or with a secondary, physical disguise applied to the puppet in case the technique fails, as it suffers from the same limitations as Henge.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E
 - Chakra: 5
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 6

Effects: You disguise your puppet to look like you.  This has all the limitations of normal Henge, but without any worry of a false impersonation, as you know how to look and act like yourself and how to make your puppet do so perfectly.  Consequently, you gain a +5 to Espionage rolls against people figuring out your puppet isn’t you.  Anything that detects normal Henge will also detect this technique, and if the puppet takes damage the technique ends immediately.

#### --( Kugutsu no Jutsu - Puppet Technique )--  
The Kairaishi’s signature technique and a unique ninjutsu, this allows the user to extend strands of Chakra from their fingertips and attach them to puppets.  Using the puppets, they can attack and manipulate them from range while remaining relatively safe themselves.  The better the user’s control over their Chakra, the better they can control puppets by the strands connecting them.

- Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 10 + X * 2
 - Upkeep: 3 + X/2
 - Range: 15 + CHA/10
 - Speed: 6 + X/2

Effects: You gain control of 1 + X puppets which are uncontrolled on the battlefield, to a maximum of ten puppets.  If they are not your puppets, you take a -3 to all actions which utilize them. While controlling puppets, you cannot make handseals, use weapons, or otherwise make use of your hands.  You can use puppets while Hidden and using a puppet to attack while hidden does not reveal you, but it does lower your Stealth TN by 5 each time, and anyone who can see Chakra can see the Chakra Threads that connect you to your puppets, gaining a bonus on their Search action equal to the Upkeep from this technique to find you.

You can change the value of X (i.e., how many puppets you are controlling) as a Speed 4, Chakra 10 + X * 2 action based on your new number of controlled puppets; your Upkeep is then modified accordingly, rounding up.

When your puppets are attacked you can advance your IC to direct them to perform defensive interrupts, let them get hit, or pay a number of AP equal to the Speed of their defensive interrupt to avoid advancing your own IC. If you are subject to attack alongside your puppets, you and your puppets are all allowed to take a defensive action, and you advance your IC only by the highest Speed interrupt taken amongst the group (though you can not elect to spend AP to avoid advancing your own IC), though if there are multiple Fatigue costs incurred, you pay for all of them.

While maintaining this technique’s Upkeep, you may use your Puppets in the following ways:

*Chakra no Ito: Attack (Speed Varies)* - You direct one of your puppets to attack.  You may direct your puppet to perform any Unarmed or Grapple Taijutsu you know, as well as any Weapon Taijutsu you know and they have the proper weapon for.  The Speed of this action is the Speed of the action you direct your puppet to take, and you pay a Chakra cost equal to the normal Stamina cost of the action you direct your puppet to perform. If it has both, you combine them into a singular Chakra cost. 

*Chakra no Ito: Move (Speed Varies)* - You move one or more of your puppets.  By default, the speed of your puppets is determined by their AGI, but you use /40 (instead of the normal /50) to determine how many yards they can move per IC; abilities you have do not modify this.  For every puppet after the first you use this action to move at the same time, you increase the divisor for determining the movement of all puppets by 5 (so moving two puppets would be using each puppet’s AGI/45, three would be AGI/50, etc).  Alternatively, you can spend 1 AP per IC spent on this action to move a puppet without lowering the divisor.

*Chakra no Ito: Defend (Speed 3, 1 + X AP)* - While controlling your puppets, you can use them to protect yourself.  This is in all ways the same as the Take the Hit action, except that its Speed is lower, and you can utilize AP to move a puppet to get them into range to protect you; you can alternatively spend no AP to utilize the standard Take the Hit action using your puppet, but in that case you use its normal Speed (of 6).

*Chakra no Ito: Puppet Show (Speed 0 Interrupt)* - Every iterative of 25 IC after you activate Kugutsu no Jutsu, you can use this action to direct all puppets you control to make basic attacks on anyone they can reach, using whatever they’re equipped with. You can have all your puppets attack the same person, or direct them to attack different targets, as you choose.  You can only direct puppets to attack in this fashion if you have been controlling them for the full 25 IC, and you did not use them in the above Attack or Defend actions for the past 25 IC.  Attacks from puppets in this manner have their attacks Held Back, as per the ability, even if you do not have it.  You may not spend AP to modify any puppet’s attack from this action, and you may not utilize any special abilities of your puppets with this action.

Anyone targeted by a puppet in this fashion defends against the puppet’s attack as if it were its normal Speed (so someone attacked by a puppet using a Katana would defend against Puppet Show as if it were a Speed 13 attack); if attacked by multiple puppets, you use simply the highest Speed puppet attack to determine valid defenses against all attacking puppets.  Similarly, anyone attacked by multiple puppets at once can declare and use the same defense against multiple puppets (though you roll separately), and only has their IC advanced by the highest Speed defense they utilize.  Thus, if Sasuke dodged two of Kankuro’s puppets and decided to Parry a third, he would only advance his IC by 3, for the speed of the Parry, rather than account for all defenses.  Costs associated with either a puppet’s attack (such as Weapon Focus) or a Defense (such as Mizuhane) are paid for each instance they are used, however.

#### --( Puppet Mastery )--
A novice puppet master needs both hands to direct the motions of a single puppet, often using a finger for each joint or something similar. A master learns how to split their chakra threads, and with as little as the twitching of a single digit and modulating of their chakra flows gracefully direct their puppets.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 5
 - Scale: 0
 - Limit: XP/500

Effects: The first time you take this ability you learn how to maintain Kugutsu no Jutsu potentially one handed; so long as you control five or less puppets at once, you can retain the use of one of your hands for making handseals, holding a weapon and so forth.  Every Rank after the first, you pick between one of two options:  Gain another Puppet, or decrease the IC interval of the Puppet Show action by 1.  

#### -=[ Puppets ]=-
The weapons of choice of puppeteers, which can range from the size of a small human to that of a towering animal.  While each Kairaishi is given a basic puppet frame with which to utilize, every puppeteer takes the time to modify them, aesthetically and functionally, to fit their purposes.  It is considered a rite of passage for defunct and shabbily-repaired puppets of former Kairaishi to be handed down to new genin with an expectation that their creativity and ingenuity will bring life to a puppet which would otherwise remain in disuse.

All Puppets begin with 30 RES and AGI, with a basic frame of a head, torso, and a pair of arms and legs, and has three slots for upgrades.  When in use, a puppet uses their controller’s DEX, and their controller’s CHA in place of STR.  Regardless of a puppet’s attributes, they are only as good as the Kairaishi which utilizes them: A puppet’s RES is limited by, and can never be higher than, their controller’s DEX, and a puppet’s AGI is similarly restricted by their controller’s CHA.  They utilize your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus instead of Physical Damage Bonus, and changes to your NDB apply to them normally.

Puppets are functionally equivalent to weapons, except with moving parts and the capacity to wield weapons themselves. They can make skill rolls for you, but they can never be used to make Medicine, Research, or Chakra Control rolls.  Because they are effectively weapons, Puppets do not get the benefit of passive or active defensive benefits you may utilize (such as a Defender’s Damage Reduction, or Domu’s Damage Reduction, or Bruiser’s Stun), however they would gain the benefits of upkeeps meant to apply to weapons (such as Chakra Flow): In such instances, each puppet gains the benefit of the Upkeep, following its normal rules (i.e., Chakra Flow normally only applies to one weapon, unless you’re using weapons with the ‘Dual’ tag: Each puppet you use would then get the benefit of Chakra Flow to one of their weapons, unless they were similarly using ‘Dual’ tagged weapons, which would have it apply to two of them).

By default you can equip Puppets with any Small weapon, paying half the normal Ryo cost to equip them with it. This reflects adjustments made to attach the weapon to the puppet’s body and breaking it down as necessary to remove unneeded hilt space to integrate it into the Puppet’s frame. It makes it impossible to use for anyone else, but grants a +3 to resist Disarm attempts.  Puppets cannot, by default, ‘two hand’ any weapon, or gain any bonuses for doing so. Puppets also have a basic slam attack (which is still a weapon attack, not an unnarmed attack) you can utilize, which is a Chakra 8, Speed 8 action that inflicts (RES/10)d6 Blunt damage; Puppets cannot have Unarmed Focus or Power Attack applied to this Slam attack.  You can apply Weapon Focus to any weapons your Puppets use (including the slam), increasing your Chakra cost for their attack.

Puppets have RES*6 Durability, which is a measure of how much damage they can take, but is otherwise incompatible with Vitality or HP: Puppets cannot be healed by Medical Ninjutsu or similar effects, nor do Puppets suffer Wounds.  Effects which specifically deal damage to HP simply affect the Puppet’s Durability.  Puppets are immune to Genjutsu and all status effects except for Immobilization and Ignite, however penalties from status effects that apply to their controller apply to their actions, as well as Wounds and Fatigue penalties.  If a Puppet ever suffers from an Immobilization Penalty of -6 or greater, that puppet cannot act or be used with any part of Kugutsu no Jutsu.

Puppets cannot have their Durability restored in combat, but on missions, assuming you have the proper tools, you can patch up a puppet and restore 10% of their maximum Durability per hour you have to work on it.  Puppets reduced to 0 Durability in combat are considered broken, and cannot be repaired until you can return to a village and have time enough to replace critical parts.  For the purposes of sealing, puppets tend to weigh around twenty-five pounds.


#### -=[ Puppet Customization ]=-
Puppets have a known weakness in the eyes of most Shinobi, which the Kairaishi are well aware: Once you’ve seen the arsenal of a puppet, you can anticipate how to deal with them and counter them effectively.  To that end, Kairaishi are aware of that line of thinking and accordingly go to great lengths to keep modifying their puppets to catch their opponents unaware by a new trick or augment that they won’t anticipate.  Every Kairaishi gains XP/100 Customization Points which can be spent on any of their puppets, though once you spend them, they are spent and can not be reallocated.  You need not spend your CP as soon as you acquire them and can save them for later use if you wish.  Puppet Upgrades utilize one of three of a Puppet’s default Upgrade Slots and accordingly are limited in how many you can apply to a single puppet, while Modifications can be taken repeatedly for the same Puppet and any restrictions to how many times you can acquire them are noted in the individual entries.  In both cases you must choose when you acquire the Upgrade or Modification which puppet you are applying it to, which can not be changed later.

#### -=[ Puppet Modifications ]=-
Modifications can be taken repeatedly and if there are limits to how many times you can take them, they will be listed in their individual entries. By defualt, all Modifications cost 1 CP, but some might cost more, in which case they will say so.

*— Quality*  
You gain 10 points you can distribute between a puppet’s RES and AGI on a one-for-one basis.  Each time after the first this is applied to a puppet (read: it is tracked separately for each puppet), the puppet gains two additional points (second time is 12 points, third is 14, etc.), keeping in mind that a puppet’s stats are limited by your own.

*— Synergistic Construction*  
A puppet of your choice gains an extra Upgrade slot.  You can apply this Modification repeatedly to the same puppet, but each Upgrade slot after the first requires an additional CP: Granting a second extra upgrade slot requires 2 CP, granting a third extra upgrade slot requires 3 CP, etc.

*— Additional Limbs*  
You can add an extra pair of legs or arms to your puppet.  An extra pair of arms grants +1 to Grapple rolls so long as the puppet is not holding anything in them, though you can always use them to have the puppet wield additional weapons instead; An extra pair of legs grants +10% to the Puppet’s movement speed. You can apply this modification to any given puppet a number of times equal to its RES/20.

*— Reinforcement*  
Your puppet gains 5 DR.  You can apply this modification to any given puppet a number of times equal to its RES/10.

#### -=[ Puppet Upgrades ]=-
Upgrades have a listed XP cost (either as an ability, or an XP cost based on the rank of Jutsu it is) which you only need to pay for once, after which you can apply that Upgrade to none, or all, of your puppets as you wish. Installing any given Upgrade on a puppet requires a free Upgrade slot on the puppet (so if it has no more slots, you can't add it to the puppet), and costs 1 Customization Point each time it's installed in any puppet.  Once an Upgrade is installed in a puppet, it's set, and can not be removed.  Upgrades which are not passive require the Puppeteer to use the Attack action to make use of them, and can not be utilized as part of Kugutsu no Jutsu’s Puppet Show action.

#### --( Detachable Arsenal )--
While most puppets are constructed as complete frames meant to be puppeteered as a whole, this upgrade allows the Kairaishi to separate its arms from its body, leaving the majority of its weight behind while enabling multiple quick attacks with any weapons it has.  The downside, of course, being that the arms themselves are not as durable as the main body, and leaving them exposed can leave you with a half-broken puppet that has lost all its offensive capabilities.

- Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 25
 - Limit: 1

Effects: As a Speed 2 * X action, you can separate your puppet’s arms from its body, allowing you to manipulate them independent of its main frame.  X is the number of arms the puppet has and that you are separating from its main body, which then increases Kugutsu’s Upkeep accordingly; if you were controlling two puppets, and detached four arms from one of them, you’d have an Upkeep of (3+6/2 = 6), as if you were controlling six puppets, rather than two.  While the arms remain detached, you can manipulate them as though they were puppets, with the following restrictions:

 - Each Arm has RES durability; if the puppet is at less than RES*X remaining durability when you separate the puppet’s arms from its frame, divide its current durability by (X+1); each arm, and its torso, are considered to have that much durability.  An arm reduced to 0 Durability is considered broken, and unusable until it can be repaired.
 - Each Arm can only support (read: is considered to have) one upgrade of the puppet they detached from, and is restricted to the following: Flamethrower, Hidden Weapon, Toxin Delivery System, or Gyro-Balanced Weapon Arsenal.  Any other upgrades the Puppet might have do not apply to any of its arms while they are detached (such as Joint Plating), and neither do any Reinforcement modifications, which apply only to the puppet body, not to any of its detached arms.
 - Each Arm can participate in Puppet Show as if it were a different Puppet, without the restriction that you need be controlling them for the past 25 IC, though the puppet itself the arms detached from still needs to qualify and while its arms are detached, the main puppet is ineligible for Puppet Show (because it has no arms or weapons!).
 - You can rejoin a puppet’s limbs together as a Speed X + Y AP action, with X being the number of limbs being reattached, and Y being how many IC it would take for the arms to get back to melee range of the puppet’s body. 

#### --( All-Terrain Adaptive-Terminus )--
Special legs designed to go over any terrain, be it rocks, water, ice, or even vertically up cliff faces, these specially-made puppet legs allow the user to extend a small amount more of their chakra threads through to the extremities, accordingly allowing transference of the tricks shinobi learn with proper chakra control.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Limit: 1

Effects: this Upgrade reduces any Immobilization Penalties the puppet suffers from that are based upon the ground by 2, and allows the puppet to benefit from their user’s Water Walking and/or Wall Walking abilities, if they have them.

#### --( Flamethrower )--
A special contraption which essentially utilizes a special variant of an Exploding Tag to create a steady stream of fire in a targeted direction; it doesn’t see mass use beyond puppets because most Ninja would rather set and forget a Tag than have to be there directing it, but it isn’t as much of an issue for a puppet.  While some Kairaishi briefly toyed with the idea of having tanks of combustible liquid or gas to combine with this, the tendency for their puppets to turn into bombs when hit by Katon quickly ended such pursuits.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 20
 - Damage: (CHA/8)d12.extra(9)
 - Speed: 12
 - Range: 15
 - Special: Burns 3
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Projectile

Effects: This hits everyone in a Line 5 yards wide in front of it, out to its maximum Range.

#### --( Glider )--
Special, foldable wings can be installed inside the arms and/or legs of a puppet to allow them to glide and lift up with the wind, allowing for safe ranged bombardment by puppets ill equipped for close combat exchange.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 25
 - Limit: 1

Effects: The puppet can fly!  Mostly.  When moved you can move it vertically as well as horizontally.  A flying puppet can not be used to carry people (and likewise, a puppet carrying anyone can not fly), but is immune to any effects reliant upon contact with the ground (such as some immobilization penalties) and cannot be targeted by melee-range techniques unless it has made a melee-range attack in the past 25 IC.

#### --( Gyro-Balanced Weapon Arsenal )--
Normally Puppets can only utilize the smallest of weapons based upon the limited space of their limbs, but with clever construction (and some elongation), you can manage to fit even bigger weapons!  Many Kairaishi swear by maximizing one's Naginata Per Puppet ratio.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: DEX/30, Max 3

Effects: Each Rank and Upgrade is applied to each Puppet individually, but all instances of this Upgrade count as taking up a single slot on any given Puppet they’re applied to.  The First Rank allows a Puppet to utilize all non-Large weapons of the Equipment section (instead of only Small weapons); The Second Rank allows a Puppet to utilize even Large weapons.  The Third Rank allows a Puppet to ‘two-hand’ a weapon and gain the respective benefits for doing so. 

#### --( Hidden Weapon )--
This Upgrade allows a puppet’s equipped weapon(s) to be more discreetly contained and quick-released, enabling it to catch enemies by surprise.  

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 20
 - Limit: 1

Effects: The first time a puppet with this upgrade attacks with a weapon in combat, it’s considered an automatic Surprise attack.  Additionally, if the equipped weapon used with this Upgrade is a Sword that has yet to be drawn, you can utilize the Iaijutsu ability with it.  Each Puppet may only benefit from each of these effects once per battle, and the costs and acquisition of weapons must be paid for normally.

#### --( Hollow Body )--
All puppets are hollow in certain places, but this Upgrade allows for a specific construction (and likely enlargement) of the puppet’s torso which allows for a spacious, shell-like area that’s large enough for a person to fit inside.  At the Kairaishi’s discretion when installing this upgrade, eye slits can be placed to look out from, allowing for Awareness rolls at a -5 penalty.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Limit: 1

Effects: This creates a hollow section in your puppet’s torso (and necessitates it to be appropriately large) that, as a Speed 8 action, someone can go in and out of and lock from the inside.  The inside fits up to three people, though any more than one and it’s a bonding experience.  While inside the puppet you may not perform handseals, attack, or be attacked, or control any other puppets.  This Upgrade is incompatible with Trap Body (i.e., a Puppet can not have both of these upgrades).

#### --( Joint Plating )--
With additional reinforcement and attempts to cover up the joints and weak spots of your puppet, you can make sure it’s more durable against whatever crazy ninjutsu it will inevitably get hit by.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Scale: 10
 - Limit: RES/40

Effects: Improves the puppet’s Durability by RES an additional time; this Upgrade can be applied to a puppet repeatedly, but each application of this Upgrade takes up its own slot.

#### --( Recon Suite )--
By adding chakra-receptive sensors to your puppet’s head, you can see and hear what the puppet sees and hears, and throw your voice, allowing you to speak without revealing your own location.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Limit: 1

Effects:  This upgrade can be toggled on or off as a Speed 0 action.  While using it, you suffer Visibility Penalties and make Awareness checks based on your puppet’s location and senses rather than your own.  Additionally, you can use a voice modulator to speak from the location of your puppet to make it ‘speak’, either using your own normal voice or an intentionally distorted and unrecognizable version of it, though it lacks any sort of sophistication to let you impersonate anyone else’s voice, it does allow you to speak while Hidden without giving yourself away.  This also grants Espionage and Stealth rolls that the Puppet makes a +3 bonus.

#### --( Toxin Delivery System )--
Ordinarily poisoning weapons requires you to apply them mid-combat for them to be effective, as they degrade quickly, but with this Upgrade, you can house special reservoirs that apply desired poisons to weaponry and aerosolize poisons from your puppet’s position, at your command.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 15
 - Limit: 1

Effects: This allows the puppet to perform a Speed +10 Poison Weapon action (which does not add to an attack’s damage) when using their weapons, applying 1+(Toxicology Ranks/10) doses of poison to the weapon(s) the Puppet is using.  Without this Upgrade, you would have to apply the Poisons to your puppet’s weapons yourself, which is usually rather inconvenient.  The cost of the Poisons and access to them must be acquired and paid for normally.

It also allows the puppet to perform a special Speed 6 action to aerosolize a toxin, spreading any inhalation poison around itself with a 15 yard radius which persists for 30 IC and applies a -4 Visibility Penalty.  You do not need to purchase the Smoke Bomb portion of this, but you do need to buy each dose of the Poison you wish to utilize in it (which it requires to function).

#### --( Tail )--
You add a singular prehensile appendage to the back of the puppet.  In addition to the innumerable amount of fashion and customization potential you just opened up for your puppet, such limbs happen to be good at providing a point of counterbalance and improving aerodynamics.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 15
 - Limit: 1

Effects: With this Upgrade, Immobilization Penalties the puppet suffers from are reduced by 1, its movement speed is increased by 10%, and it gains +1 to Grapple rolls, as well as having an additional limb for use in a Grapple, if beneficial.

#### --( Trap Body )--
This Upgrade modifies the puppet’s torso to have an elaborate series of wires and launchers which, when triggered, fire toward and wrap around a target, then quickly retract to pull them into the puppet’s body to capture them within it.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 12
 - Range: 5
 - Speed: 12
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Requires: Hollow Body Upgrade
 - Tags: Contact

Effects: When a puppet this Upgrade is installed in is attacked in melee, you can declare Trap Body as a Defensive Interrupt in response to the attack.  The Puppet automatically blocks the attack and, so long as it is not destroyed, then extends wires and chains toward its attacker, as it tries to grab them and pull them into itself.  Make a Taijutsu Accuracy roll, which is defended against as a Speed 8 attack (which is considered a melee attack).  If they fail, they are Grappled by the puppet and locked inside the puppet's Hollow Body.  Unlike a regular Grapple (and Hollow Body), the defender can not move at all while Grappled, though the puppet can move and be moved as normal without the defender getting a chance to restrain the puppet.

The person caught becomes immune to all area of effect attacks and effects on the field, which can still hit and affect the puppet normally but not the person inside them; attacks made from anyone other than the Kairishi controlling the Trap Body Puppet suffer a -3 Accuracy, and are incapable of being Called Shots, as they can not clearly target the person inside.

The person inside can not use Combo, Weapon, or Grapple taijutsu attacks against the puppet, and any attacks made from within the puppet ignore the puppet's Damage Reduction automatically; they also can not target or affect anyone except for the puppet, until they free themselves from the puppet, by destroying it or being freed voluntarily by the puppet's controller as a Speed 6 action.  A puppet can only be grappling one person in this way at a time, and can not utilize this upgrade if it already has someone inside of it (i.e., if someone is already in its Hollow Body).


## Sabechi
The Sabechi were one of the only clans that would find themselves allied to the Kaguya, but not in the way it would seem. Most of them formed criminal Kyosha and would offer protection for money until the settlement ran out of things to offer. That’s when the Sabechi would lure surrounding Kaguya forces to take over that settlement and move on elsewhere. The Henzaki, who came to the settlements aid, assisted in routing the criminal Kyosha that contained Sabechi, and in order to preserve their clan, were invited to the Pride, in which case the Sabechi had no choice but to accept.

#### -=[ Rustblood ]=-

The blood of a Sabechi is poisonous. Aside from minor conveniences, like it being harder to give them transfusions and the sabechi as a whole being ineligible for blood donations, it can also be used in combat as a very potent toxin.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base cost: 20
 - Limit: 1

Effects: Your blood contains a powerful cocktail of poisons. By cutting yourself, you may spend 10 HP (not Vitality!) as a Speed 10 action and apply your natural poison to a weapon you are holding.

Your Natural Poison has the stats of an Injury Vector poison from the equipment section, except it can be applied to any blunt, piercing, or slashing weapon. When you use this ability to apply a poison, select one of the Special Options listed under Poison in the Equipment section that can be applied to an Injury Poison. Your poison has that effect.

You may use Chakra Control in place of your Toxicology ranks when using your Natural Poison. This applies both to the Toxicology roll and for determining the effects of your Poison. Note that the roll is still a Toxicology roll, using your bonuses to that and not Chakra Control (except for skill ranks).

The Talent Rare Poisons does not apply to your Natural Poison.

#### -=[ Mithridatism ]=-

Constant exposure to the Sabechi’s own venom eventually has their bodies produce antibodies to a variety of poisons, enabling them to quickly shrug off even the nastiest of toxins.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 5
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: RES/30, Max 4

Effects: You reduce the duration of any Poison you suffer from by RES/(5-Rank), and any status effects caused by its Special Options by 1 per Rank, to a minimum of 0. If the Poison has multiple special effects, the reduction applies to all of them.

#### -=[ Ichor ]=-
The toxicity in your blood has reached new heights, and your control over the exact composition has vastly improved.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 100
 - Limit: 1
 - Requires: 30 Chakra Control or 25 Toxicology Ranks

Effects: When you use your Natural Poison, you may choose and apply two Special Effects. Further, you increase the Severity of all Status Effects caused by your poison by 1. 

#### --( Secret Technique: Demonic Blood Cultivation )--
Sabechi are capable of manipulating the chakra and chemical composition of their blood, even while it is in someone else's body. This makes their poison more akin to a biological weapon than a simple poison.

 - Type: Medical Ninjutsu, D Rank
 - Cost: 15 Chakra
 - Speed: 5 or +5 
 - Special: Interrupt

Effects: This jutsu automatically affects someone who is affected by your Natural Poison, without a defense. You may choose to accelerate your poison, applying (higher of Toxicology Ranks/2 or Chakra Control Ranks/2) IC worth of the poison's effects immediately, reducing its remaining duration by the same amount. This mostly applies to the poison's damage, but may also apply to Special Effects which are timed, such as a Manchineel Tree's Suffocation. Afterwards, you may change which Special Effect(s) your Poison has, which take place immediately. This can be done as its own Speed 5 action, or done as part of another Interrupt as a +5 Speed Link. If used in response to an attack, the new poison applies to the attack and not the old poison. This is considered Medical Ninjutsu for purposes of interacting with other effects, but the Sabechi does not need to qualify for medical jutsu to learn it.

#### -=[ Predatory Protrusions ]=-
Every Sabechi has a way to deliver their poison naturally, without the aid of weapons—such is the nature of their bloodline. As their skill expands and chakra develops, it’s not unheard of for a Sabechi to begin manifesting other mutations.

 - Type: Ability
 - Cost: 20
 - Scale: 10
 - Limit: 1 + XP/2000

Effect:  For each rank in this ability, you gain access to one of the Predatory Protrusion options, presented below. They are natural Weapons, and as such can not be disarmed. In addition to its other effects, it gives you a cumulative -5 penalty to disguise yourself as someone else, unless they have similar anatomy.

#### --( Scorpion Tail )--
You have grown a large scorpion tail extending down from the bottom of your spine. Your Scorpion Tail counts as a weapon that is always available and does not require hands to use. It has the following traits:

 - Stamina: 12
 - Damage: 12d10
 - Accuracy: -4, or +2 when being used in a grapple or used to establish a grapple.
 - Range: 5 + RES/20
 - Speed: 12
 - Tags: Chain, Piercing, Large, Two-Handed

Effects: You may spend 10 HP after damaging an opponent to expose them to your poison. You may use your tail to perform Disarm and Grab using its Range. It grants a +3 bonus to Grapple rolls used with it. Grappling someone with your Tail does not impose a penalty to your Dodge or Parry speed. The person you're grappling can not move further away from you than your Tail's range: if they would do something that would move them further, you're moved as well (and vice-versa), and either may attempt to restrain the other, as described under Grab. Once someone is grappled with your Tail, you can perform any Grapple jutsu of C or lower rank on them, with the exception of Headbutt, Suplex, and Pressure Point. Joint Lock uses the Tail's damage instead of unarmed attack damage. Your tail is considered to have unlimited limbs for the purposes of grapple, and is considered a Weapon.

#### --( Fangs )--
You have protruding, hollow canines protruding near poison glands in your mouth. So long as you can get close enough, fangs are a potent poison delivery system.

 - Stamina: 10
 - Damage: 2d10
 - Speed: 5
 - Special: Ignores Damage Reduction
 - Restriction: May only be used in a Grapple.
 
Effects: This attack hits automatically. If you deal damage, your target is exposed to your Natural Poison, and you remain latched on until you are no longer in control of the grapple.  While Latched, your Natural Poison's Duration does not decrease, except through using Demonic Blood Alchemy.
 
#### --( Quills )--  
While not true ‘needles’, some Sabechi actually have the ability to straighten the hairs on their head, which tend to be much thicker than normal hair, enough so to inject trivial amounts of their poison.  When used in groups, however, it can be quite deadly.

 - Stamina: 5
 - Damage: 1d4
 - Accuracy: -2
 - Range: 5 + STR/5
 - Speed: 10
 - Special: Ignores Armor and half of an opponent's DR
 - Type: Small, Thrown, Senbon, Piercing

Effects: You can throw a single Quill, using the above stats, or throw multiple at once, in which case you treat it as a standard Multithrow. You may spend 10 HP when you declare an attack with Quills to expose anyone damaged to your Natural Poison.

These are considered Senbon and may be used in all the same ways Senbon can, although they do not retain their shape for long once thrown and thus can't be stored for any jutsu or usage that requires them to be prepared ahead of time (like Raining Needles).  This also means that quills are considered expended after use and thus unable to be retrieved and reused, though you have a functionally unlimited amount of Quills.

While these are not actual Senbon, you may utilize Senbon-specific abilities as if they were (meaning Combat Acupuncture, Senbon User, and Surgial Precision apply to them if you have them), although Senbon User allows you to use RES, rather than DEX, in place of STR to determine your damage bonus with your Quills (regular Senbon still use DEX in place of STR).

#### --( Saliva )--
You cultivate caustic bacteria in your mouth, similar to a komodo dragon. Glands in your throat allow you to spit this poison at long range, similar to a cobra. 

 - Type: Ninjutsu
 - Chakra: 10
 - Damage: (CHA/8)d10
 - Speed: 0
 - Range: 5
 - Special: May only be used once every 20 IC
 - Requires: 5 AP + 10 HP per use

Effects: This attack is considered a Speed 10 attack for the purposes of defending against it, and for how much damage it deals, both of which are modified if you choose to spend AP to reduce its effective Speed (on top of its base 5 AP cost). If it hits, it exposes your target to your Natural Poison even if it does not do damage. This attack uses your Ninjutsu Accuracy, and its Rank is considered equal to the highest rank of Ninjutsu you know.

#### --( Oily Skin ) --
You skin has grown an odd coloration or pattern. More tactically important, you skin has glands that can produce a thin mucus membrane on command to cover your body. Clothes thankfully don't interfere with this process. 

As a Speed 10, HP Cost X * 10 action you may apply a "Poison Coating" to yourself that lasts for X * 30 minutes or until it exposes someone to your Natural Poison X times. While the coating is active, any time you touch someone else they become exposed to your Natural Poison. This includes every unarmed attack that hits you or that you hit someone else with, and every 10 IC in a grapple. So long as you have used this protrusion in the past 100 IC, you gain a +5 on rolls made to end a Grapple (suchas Break or Escaple grapple), and similar rolls made to escape physical restraints (though it would not apply to, say, a Nara's Shadow Bind). This action does not break Combos.

## Swordsman Corps
From this war came very inventive swords smiths. Though they had no official clan name, they had their own sort of Private Kyosha. A Guild of sorts. They swore by the craft and no matter where they stood on the war, they bore the mark and were allied to each other. Though inevitable facing each other on the battlefield, they would fight one another with honor, yielding their life to the better swordsman, some of which, would hate to see a smith die, and show mercy. These smiths saw that the war would come down to the strongest manifestation of Ninshu. It was the Swordsman Corp that came together to join The Pride before even being asked.

**Members of the Swordsman Corps begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

#### -=[ Precision ]=-
Any ninja who uses a weapon seriously knows something about it beyond ;put the pointy end into the other person;. Mist's swordsmen generally understand their weapons, knowing the importance of a sword being well-balanced, and just how to cut someone to make the most of their weapon's momentum.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 5
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: DEX/20, Max 4

Effects: You have a special “Sword Damage Bonus” of DEX/15 (to, as usual, a single decimal point). You may use this in place of your physical damage bonus whenever wielding a sword, if you prefer. Each rank beyond the first reduces the divisor by 1, to a minimum of DEX/12.

Increases to your Physical Damage Bonus do not affect your Sword Damage Bonus.  On the other hand, anything which reduces your Physical Damage Bonus (such as many wounds) does not reduce your Sword Damage Bonus.

#### -=[ Blademaster ]=-
Members of the swordsman corps do not put as much effort into training with their swords as other ninja do into learning the basics of ninjutsu--they put in more. This rigorous training tends to leave members of the swordsman corp disproportionately grim, and exceptionally dangerous.

 - Type: Ability
 - Cost: 10
 - Requires: Precision

Effects: When using a sword, you use DEX/8 rather than DEX/10 to determine your bonus to Accuracy. Additionally, when making a sword attack you may choose to replace your regular accuracy with an accuracy roll (using 1d20 instead of 10 for the base value).  If you choose to use your Physical Damage Bonus with a sword attack instead of your Sword Damage Bonus from the Precision ability (found directly above this one), you do not receive the benefits of Blademaster on that attack.

#### -=[ Silver Flash ]=-
Once a sword kata has been perfected, you don't stop practicing it. If it is a ten-minute kata, and you know every step perfectly, you will do it in nine minutes, and then in eight. You learn how to not think about what you're doing, and instead simply do it. You learn to stop being a person wielding a sword, and become a sword guided by your subconscious.

 - Type: Ability
 - Base Cost: 10
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: DEX/40

Effects: Every rank reduces the base Speed of your sword attacks by 1, but increases their damage for the purpose of causing wounds by 5%.

#### -=[ Daisho ]=-
Most members of Mist's Swordsman Corps have one sword which is distinct to them, and they learn to use it like an extension of their own body, often to the exclusion of other weapons. A select few, however, find themselves with the need or desire to own more than one. If these individuals are considered worthwhile, the Corps will allow them to have another one of Mist's famous swords forged for them.

Technically, "daisho" refers to a paired set of weapons used by samurai. It's a very precise word, with deep significance and a great deal of ceremonial importance. Well, at some point in the past some member of the Swordsman Corps decided to present themselves as a samurai, and adopted the term to refer to their own paired weapons. It caught on, because while ninja don't actually know anything about samurai behavior, it sounds impressive to claim you follow their ways, and now a "Daisho" among the swordsman corps refers to any set of weapons an individual personally values.

 - Type: Talent

Effects: This may only be taken after you already have a clan sword (meaning, you are of chuunin or higher rank). You acquire a second sword, which follows all the normal rules for a clan sword, designed separately from your first one. You may take this talent multiple times, acquiring a new sword each time.

#### -=[ Clan Swords ]=-

Upon becoming a Chuunin or reaching 2500 XP, a Mist swordsman will receive their own, personalized blade. Most of them will have kept, used, and taken care of a single sword, usually a katana, from their days in the academy--in these cases, they usually opt to have that weapon reforged.

Though they don't partake in the forging process, the ninja will be there the entire time, and it's followed by a ritual consecration, and a four-day period of solitary meditation in which the shinobi is alone with only their blade, fasting and subsisting off only just enough water to stave off dehydration. The relationship between sword and swordsman is... interesting. Most swordsmen take care of their blade better than their teammates, and it's not even considered unusual for them to name and talk to it (if the sword starts talking back, though, that just means they're crazy).

There's more to this than lasting effects of the hallucinations from four days of fasting and partial dehydration. Members of the swordsman corps always know where their sword is, in terms of distance and direction. It could be on the other side of the world, and given enough time, they'd be able to track it down.

Many claim their swords are 'loyal' to them (others just say their weapons are unique and they're the only ones who know how to use them properly); and, indeed, a borrowed or stolen sword functions as an ordinary katana, nothing more, in the hands of anyone but its rightful owner.

In the event one of these swords is hopelessly lost (say, tossed to the bottom of the ocean, or thrown into a volcano) a new one can be forged for the swordsman, though this is not done lightly; if given the chance, most would literally fight through hell to get their sword back. It takes four weeks to obtain a replacement sword, after which the original will no longer recognize its former owner. A member of the swordsman corps who accepts a replacement blade when it's in any way possible to reclaim their old one is viewed with severe disdain by their fellow swordsmen. (Using a regular katana in the meanwhile, however, is perfectly acceptable).

Your sword begins with 20 points which you can spend on it at your discretion. The first thing for you to do is choose its Structure features; this is its basic shape and so on. There are 5 primary characteristics to select here, and each one has a point cost listed next to it; for example, "(2) Small" means it costs 2 of your 20 points to make your weapon have the ‘Small’ tag added to it.

After selecting all your Structure options, you move on to Features. Although prices are in the same format, the layout is different.

Features relate to the true nature of your weapon, as measured by its favorance and balance between Yin and Yang Chakra, according to its chosen construction of its Blade, Hilt, and Tassel, three tiers that you can choose to spend points on.  Blade features can be taken at will, while Hilt features require at least 5 of your sword customization points in the associated group; to take a Tassel feature, you must have spent 10 points in that group, and may only take one Tassel feature for your sword in total, even from the same group.

For example, if you spent 7 points on Blade features and 3 points on Hilt features in Yin, you could take either of the Tassel Yin features. You would still be restricted to Blade features for Balance and Yang features, unless you also spent enough points in those trees.

You must spend at least 1 point in one of the three primary trees of Features, and any unused points can not be spent after its construction, and are simply lost.

#### -=[ 1. Structure ]=-

###### a. Damage Type
Every weapon must have at least one damage type. If it has more than one type, you can decide which damage type to utilize each time you attack (though if using a jutsu or ability which requires a certain damage type, you must use that type).

 - (0) Slashing
 - (0) Piercing
 - (0) Blunt
 - (2) Two of the above
 - (5) Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing

###### b. Size
A weapon may have only one size. Size determines both which jutsu and abilities it functions with, as well as its die size.

 - (2) Small: *d6 damage, -2 base Speed
 - (0) Medium: *d10 damage
 - (2) Large: *d12 damage, +2 base Speed

###### c. Two-Handed
Only Medium and Large weapons may be two-handed. If a weapon is two-handed, it can't be used one-handed unless you have the Monkey Grip ability. You may only choose one of these options.

 - (0) One-Handed
 - (3) Two-Handed

###### d. Number
Some swordsmen have more than one weapon. The Dual tag does not actually grant you an additional sword, just means your weapon is optimized for dual wielding (as per the ability). If you take Paired, you get a second weapon which has 15 points to spend normally, and may not take Paired itself.

 - (3) Dual
 - (5) Paired

###### e. Damage
Not something you spend points on, this time! Of the three primary feature sets below (Yin, Balance, and Yang), determine which one you have the most points in. If there's a tie, choose one. That determines your sword's Speed, Stamina cost, and damage dice.

 - Yin: Stamina 9, Speed 11, 6d_ damage
 - Balance: Stamina 12, Speed 13, 8d_ damage
 - Yang: Stamina 14, Speed 15, 10d_ damage

#### -=[ 2. Features ]=-

###### a. Yin
*Blade Features*   
(2) (Small Only) +1 Accuracy, -1 Damage Bonus.  Can be taken twice.  
(2) -1 Stamina Cost.  Can be taken three times.
