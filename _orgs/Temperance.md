During the war, a collective of monks studied the nature of chakra and it’s influence over the elements. They combined their efforts and worked together to instill this power into their bloodlines and it gave them power over the very environment itself. They could make land in an instant, and bring peace or ruin where they felt it was just.

## Hozuki (Primal Sea)
The monks of the Temperance reached out to the Hozuki clan for their ability to turn into water. While this was not an inherent connection to nature but more of a Ninshu ability to transform, it was refined under the training of the monks, someone that the clan would not want to pass up. A rare chance to test their abilities against other elemental masters.

**Hozuki begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Hozuki begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Water.

#### --( Suika no Jutsu - Hydration Technique )--
The Hozuki clan’s pride is the ability to liquify their entire body, from bones to organs to hair, turning into living water.  Although they normally maintain a humanoid form, there is nothing preventing them from turning into a puddle and slipping under a door or escaping down a drain--though they lose their ability to perceive their surroundings if they don’t keep at least their head in tact.

 - Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 10
 - Speed: Special

Effects: Liquifying is a Speed 5 Interrupt (which does not require a roll to succeed), while solidifying is a Speed 0 action.  While in water form, the following effects are applied:

 - You take only 25% damage from Suiton, and 50% from Katon.
 - You cannot block Doton or Raiton.
 - You take +50% damage from Raiton, and any non-environmental Shock status effects they apply also inflict you with a Stun of twice their severity.
 - You are immune to all non-Energy-wound dealing Taijutsu, and medical ninjutsu (except for Ranshinshou).
 - Nintaijutsu deal damage based on their respective element.
 - You are immune to, and do not suffer the penalties of existing, Wounds.
 - You can breathe underwater.
 - Your Physical Damage Bonus is set to 0.
 - You cannot grapple or be grappled, and ignore non-Internal Immobility Penalties and effects which work by restraining or caging you.  
 - You always have an additional 10+(Chakra Control ranks/2) gallons of water to use with Suiton techniques, which nobody else may access. If you figure out why, you get a cookie. This water is never used up, or considered to be added to the battlefield, and can not be utilized for techniques with an Upkeep, for clones, or sealed via Fuinjutsu (such as confinement seal scroll, or element sealing method).
 - You cannot be burnt, poisoned, or ignited, and ignore the effects of those statuses while in liquid form; their durations still decrease normally (and Ignite automatically ends).
 - You cannot open any Gates, do not gain any bonuses from having any Gates open and while liquified, you can’t generate or spend Gate-specific AP, nor do you suffer the normal Wounding chance. You regain all benefits of Gates once you solidify and do not have to re-open any Gates opened before liquifying, however.

You may not liquify (though you can still solidify) if you are suffering from a Paralysis effect which was caused by a Raiton technique. If incapacitated while liquified you revert to a semi-solid, translucent gel-like form. In this state you do not heal at all unless immersed in water, at which point you begin recovering normally.

#### --( Masakana Namiochiru - Demon Fish Wave Crash )--
Pulling in water from all around you and extending your chakra from your watery form into it all, you turn into a mass of animate water which a vague outline of yourself at the center. Despite the jutsu’s name, the water constantly tends to change shape and features, but most who see it can swear they see something demonic formed. This not only offers protection to the user, but also allows them to come crashing down upon their enemies as well.

 - Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 25
 - Upkeep: 8
 - Speed: 12
 - Requires: Suika no Jutsu active

Effects: You no longer take extra damage from Raiton, and are not stunned by it. Your Physical Damage Bonus is no longer reduced to zero, though you can not utilize any Taijutsu except for Basic Unarmed Attacks and Crashing Tsunami, below. When you first activate this technique you can absorb up to CHA/5 gallons of water from the battlefield into yourself, gaining +Gallons/10 to your PDB and +Gallons/2 in Damage Reduction (both of which do not count Suika’s inherent gallons, as you can not absorb yourself, Xavis).  You can hold, and benefit from, an extra CHA/2 gallons of water this way.

The water which you absorb into yourself can not be used by anyone else to fuel Suiton techniques, but can be converted or destroyed (via Boiling or Water Sky Convergence, for example), though this does not apply to Suika’s inherent gallons of water.

###### --( Crashing Tsunami )--
Less of a technique and more of just a watery slam of a Hozuki’s body when enlarged and engorged by Masakana Namiochiru, it is nonetheless effective at using the full weight of the water gathered to overwhelm opponents.

 - Type: Suiton Taijutsu
 - Stamina: 18
 - Damage: (CHA/10)d12
 - Speed: 14

Effects: You may move up to CHA/5 additional yards when you use this attack (in addition to the normal movement when attacking), and you may collect up to CHA/5 additional gallons of water into yourself during this movement, assuming they are present on the battlefield.  This technique uses your Physical Damage Bonus and deals Blunt wounds.

#### --( Gosuiwan no Jutsu - Great Water Arm Technique )--
Putting their hydration into practical, but less-extreme use, a Hozuki can force moisture into a single limb (typically an arm) and give themselves what amounts to hydraulic muscles. The difficulty of this technique comes from how essential it is to properly control the distribution of water throughout the body, but when used properly, this gives superhuman strength.

 - Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 20 + X*2
 - Upkeep: X/2
 - Speed: 8
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: This increases your Physical Damage Bonus by X, to a maximum of CHA/30. This bonus is doubled against inanimate objects, up to and including ninjutsu-made walls, such as Earth Shore Return, though it never is doubled against people.  This technique’s effects are suppressed whenever you liquify via the Hydration technique, and this cannot be used while Suika no Jutsu is active.

## Hitori (Summer)
Originally, the Hitori and the Temperance were enemies. They were so powerful, that they felt they did not require a Kyosha. However, as the chakra suppressing power of the Way of Sun and Moon threatened them, they needed to find people who would protect them, and fast. Unfortunately, they burned most of their bridges, and were reluctant to ally with the Temperance, but after being shown their kindness and generosity, accepted their friendship.

**Hitori begin with 1 less Unique Point.**
 
Hitori begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Wind ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes Katon and Fuuton.

#### -=[ Shakuton - Scorch Release ]=-  
Combining Fire and Wind chakra results in the advanced nature of ‘Scorch Release’; as the name suggests, it involves using extreme heat as a weapon, with powerful users being able to reduce opponents to ash or evaporate the liquid inside their body, sapping away their strength.

Any Katon or Fuuton technique can be converted to Shakuton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes:   
 - Deal 75% normal damage, but can not be blocked
 - They gain +CHA/30 to their Accuracy
 - Inflict a Dehydration status of severity (1 per Rank of the jutsu) + CHA / (90 - 10*Rank). In other words, for an E-Rank this is 1+CHA/80, for a D-Rank it is 2+CHA/70, and so on, up to 5+CHA/40 for A-rank techniques
 - Shakuton can increase a victim’s Dehydration status up to a maximum of 3+(CHA/8)
 - Shakuton can not inflict Burns or Ignite
 - Fuuton converted to Shakuton may not be used with a Fan.
 - Any Ignite a technique would normally inflict instead adds +5% to Wounding per severity of Ignite
 - Any jutsu converted with an inherent bonus to Wounding instead applies a Stun of (Wounding Bonus%)/20, rounded down
 - Shakuton techniques can not be reduced below Speed 5, after all other modifications

 Shakuton is weak to Suiton, and strong against Fuuton and Doton

###### --( Dehydration )--
This is a Status Effect, applied on hit. Every point of Dehydration applies a -1 penalty to the victim’s Stamina rolls, and lowers the victim’s Physical Damage Bonus by 0.3.  Dehydrate stacks fully with itself; Dehydration 3 added to Dehydration 2 makes a single Dehydrate 5 status, which applies a -5 to Stamina, and a -1.5 to their PDB.  Dehydrate from the same source (person) stacks fully with itself; if you suffer Dehydrate from different people, only the highest severity applies.

There is one exception: Dehydrate’s Stamina penalty does not stack with Burns, and if you happen to be suffering from both status effects, you take the higher of the two, rather than both, to Stamina rolls: If you were suffering from Dehydration 2, and received a Burns 3, your Stamina penalty would be -3, and your PDB penalty would be -0.6. If you then cleared your Burns status, the Stamina penalty would lower to -2.  

Any effects which reduce Stamina penalties reduce the severity of your Dehydration by the same amount. However, unlike Burns, Dehydrate is not cleared when failing a fatigue roll, and instead it is only reduced by half (rounding up) of its original value.

Outside of battle, this status effect goes away at a rate of one per minute.

#### --( Kasou no Jutsu - Cremation Technique )--  
You focus your chakra on a victim, and simply light them ablaze.

 - Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 20
 - Range: CHA/2
 - Speed: 15
 - Special: X Ignite + Special

Effects: This technique ignores the normal rule that Shakuton can not inflict Ignite; X is the victim’s Dehydration status (and thus, if you use it on someone without it, this technique has no effect), and does enjoy Shakuton’s typical +CHA/40 Accuracy.  Your target’s Dehydrate status is removed (after applying the Ignite) if they pass a status roll; if they fail, then their Dehydrate status is instead only lowered by half, rounding up.

In addition to the Ignite, your target suffers a penalty to their Resistance equal to X, which doesn't go away until the Ignite itself does.

#### -- ( Sabaku no Keshin - Incarnation of Desert )--
You project your chakra out across the battlefield, with devastating results.  The temperature rises, plants begin to wilt and wither, and hopefully nothing nearby is particularly combustible.

 - Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 30
 - Upkeep: 6
 - Speed: 16
 - Area: Ninjutsu Damage Bonus * 2
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental

Effects: Everyone within the range except you has their Dehydrate status increased by 1+(CHA/50) when you activate this technique, and every 10 IC afterward, so long as you maintain its Upkeep.  Anyone within the area (which moves with you) with a Dehydration status (again, except you) takes a penalty to their Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to their Dehydrate status, and has their Ninjutsu Damage Bonus lowered by 0.3 per point of Dehydration they have; this penalty remains until they leave the area (or remove their Dehydration status).

## Monkasei (Primal Earth, Noble)
The Monkasei and the Senju are shapers of Earth. They were one of the original founders of the Temperance and built all of their temples within the Mountaintops. Dedicated to making the world a better place, they often make battlefields a living nightmare to fight in. Once the Hitori joined the Temperance, it was not long before the war needed to stop because their combination left crippling losses to all sides but their own. [This clan is Noble]

**Monkasei begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Monkasei begin with Elemental Aptitude for Doton and Fuuton ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Jiton, which includes Doton and Fuuton.

#### -=[ Jiton - Magnetism Release ]=-
Though commonly referred to as ‘magnetic’ Chakra, in actuality it is a little more nuanced: Jiton can react with even non-ferrous metals, and Monkasei are never so obvious as to carry around dozens of pounds of iron to make use of their Kekkei Genkai.  Rather, they tend to exert control over another substance--almost always Sand, though that might just be a matter of convenience, as it’s light-weight and there’s an infinite supply in their homeland--which is infused with a metal in some form or fashion to thereby control it.  Previous Kazekages were known for their Iron Sand and Gold Dust usage, but every Monkasei has their own preferences as to how they utilize their talent, and it’s not known whether the choice is simply a matter of preference, or if different Monkasei can control different metals better than others.

Note that while you are manipulating *some* amount of metal, Jiton-converted techniques are ‘Sand’ techniques, not ‘Metal’:  a Jiton Tremorsense would let you do so on Sand, not on Metal.  Likewise, Jiton Earth Shaping would let you shape magnificent sand castles, not manipulate metal walls or objects.


Any Fuuton or Doton technique can be converted to Jiton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes:
 - Blocking reduces the damage of Jiton techniques by 25% less.
 - Non-Upkeep Jiton which are Environmental, or Ground-based, create a number of Gallons of Sand equal to twice their rank: 2 for E, 4 for D, etc.
 - All other Jiton techniques have a Sand cost, in Gallons, according to the Rank of the jutsu: 2 for E, 4 for D, 8 for C, 16 for B, 32 for A.  Jiton with Upkeeps require an amount equal to their Upkeep, or the amount listed for their Rank, whichever is higher.
 - Interrupt Jiton do not create Sand; those of Rank D or below remove all Gallons of Sand used with them from the battlefield, while those of Rank C or higher remove only half the Gallons of Sand used with them.
 - Non-Interrupt Fuuton converted to Jiton have their base Speed increased by 1 per Rank (E = +1, D = +2, etc, up to A = +5).
 - Jiton with Upkeeps grant the Monkasei an amount of Charge equivalent to the Upkeep the Monkasei suffers from while maintaining them; Upkeeps from other sources (such as Chakra Strengthening) do not grant the Monkasei any Charge.
 - Fuuton converted to Jiton may not be used with a fan.
 - If a Jiton has its Seal Speed reduced to 0, then you need not make any handseals for it at all.
 - Jiton is strong against Doton and Raiton, but weak against Fuuton.


###### --( Charge )--
This is a status effect, applied to the Monkasei, representing their control over their element–in this case, metal-infused Sand–and the ease of which they can utilize it the more their chakra is infused into it.  While exhausting to maintain control over so much material, Monkasei have learned to turn a weakness into a strength, in the following ways.

All values of X are based on your current Charge status:
 - +X/2 to Chakra Exhaustion rolls for Jiton techniques
 - X/4 reduction to the base Speed of all Jiton Interrupt techniques, to a minimum of base Speed 4, ignoring normal limits.
 - -X/2 Seal Speed
 - -X/2 Delay (if it has any, to a minimum of 0).
 - Damage dealing Jiton have their dice that roll below X/4 rerolled once, up to a maximum of (die size/4).

The last benefit can be confusing!  So, for example, as long as your Charge was 4 or more, your Jiton Wind Cutter would have all of its damage dice rerolled once if they came up as a 1.  This can be done automatically if using the Dice Golem bot by adding ‘ro1’ to the damage dice calculation, meaning Wind Cutter would be typed as the following: (2d4ro1 * 5 + NDB * Speed).  Higher Charge levels than 4 would never increase Wind Cutter’s ability to reroll its dice above 1, because it is capped at (die size/4), rounding down, thus, 4/4 = 1.

#### --( Purification )--
So long as a Monkasei has access to some sort of solid ground (i.e., is not floating in the middle of the ocean), and has a few handfuls of their choice of metal shavings, a Monkasei can apply pressure to rock, soil, wood, or similar surfaces and materials to, essentially, pulverize them into miniscule splinters and shavings to be made use of.  Most Monkasei prefer to carry around materials already infused with their choice of metal to avoid this process (and to avoid showing its usage off to anyone), but in times of need, Monkasei can gather up more material to make use of their kekkai genkai.  If you ever have to ask whether you can bore through a material with this jutsu, assume the answer is ‘No’.

 - Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank E
 - Chakra: +5
 - Speed: +X
 - Seal Speed: +X

Effects: This is used as a link with any Jiton technique which creates Sand; the technique creates triple the normal amount. X is based off of the Rank of the Jutsu (E=1, D=2, etc).  Thus, an E-rank Jiton would create six gallons of sand, instead of two, at Chakra +5, Speed +1, Seal Speed +1; a D-rank Jiton would create twelve gallons at Chakra +5, Speed +2, Seal Speed +2, etc.

Keep in mind that ‘Sand’ is more like ‘weathered and eroded bits of dirt and stone’, but it works for a Monkasei’s purposes.


#### --( Sabaku Kyu - Sand Coffin )--
No one likes Sand.  It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating.  And it gets everywhere. Which the Monkasei tend to use to their advantage in order to slow down and debilitate their opponents through tactical, frustrating maneuvering that makes everything chafe.

 - Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: +(2+X/4)
 - Speed: +Y

Effects:  This can be added onto any damage-dealing Jiton Ninjutsu; X is the Gallons of Sand utilized in the Jutsu, while Y is the Rank of the Jutsu it is used with.  In addition to the attack’s normal damage and effects, anyone hit by the technique also takes a (1 + Y) Immobility Penalty, though in doing so you ‘use up’ the gallons of sand the jutsu required which stick to, and slow down, the movement of those affected.  

Against someone already suffering from an Immobility Penalty caused by Sand Coffin you stack the Immobility Penalty as a single status (unlike normal), but the amount is reduced to Y, rather than (1+Y). Thus if you used a Jiton Earthworm Sabaku Kyu, it would initially apply a -2 Immobility Penalty; if hit again while still suffering from Sabaku Kyu’s Immobility Penalty, repeated applications would only increase the Immobility Penalty by 1.  

Once the Sand is no longer applying a penalty to someone, it is added back to the battlefield for use.

If used with a Jutsu which already applies an Immobility Penalty (such as a Jiton-converted Clay Bullet), you need not pay its normal Chakra or Speed cost. Doing so replaces its normal Immobility penalty with Sand Coffin’s, although any special rules regarding the status effect itself remain, and apply to the total penalty from Sabaku Kyu: a Retsudotensho with Sabaku Kyu will have anyone in its effect retaining their full Sabaku Kyu-applied Immobility Penalty until they leave the area, not fading over time (at which point it ends immediately).

#### --( Sabaku Sousou - Sand Burial )--
Once a target is encased in enough Sand, it’s a simple, yet devastating, measure to utilize their control over Jiton to crush a person in much the same way they crush up rocks or dirt.

 - Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 10 + X * 3
 - Damage: (X * 4)d20
 - Speed: 20
 - Delay: 10
 - Seal Speed: 20
 - Requires: Target to have an Immobilization Penalty from Sand Coffin

Effects:  X is the current Immobilization Penalty of your target from Sand Coffin, to a maximum of 10, which ends immediately when you use this technique (including a penalty from Retsudotensho). This technique can not be dodged (as the sand is already stuck to, and on, the target), though other defenses could be utilized (such as Block, if you were doing so when targeted by this technique): the target is simply crushed from all sides by the sand that’s been piled onto them. If you inflict a Wound, you inflict a Blunt, and Slashing Wound of one tier lower, to a minimum of Minor.  You can not make Called Shots with Sand Burial, nor can you have damage from other techniques (such as Eye of the Storm) added to its damage.

## Senju (Spring, Noble)
The original founders of The Temperance sought to understand man’s connection to nature and ninshu. The Senju was the first clan that formed it. They made it the goal to use their connection with nature to bring peace to the land and try and discover others who would share their vision of using their Ninshu to help Nature heal the world.

**Senju begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Senju begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water and Earth, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Mokuton, which includes Suiton and Doton.

#### -=[ Mokuton - Wood Release ]=-
The Senju bloodline, once famed for their limitless talents, have fallen far, but one trait remains--or, rather, it's the only one that can be recognized as a sign of Senju heritage. That is Mokuton, combining Water and Earth natured chakra to produce wood-related jutsu. It should be noted that this is wood, specifically, and to a lesser extent, trees--they don't have (despite what legends claim) plant empathy, the ability to restore life to wilting flowers, or anything similar. 

Any Suiton or Doton technique can be converted to Mokuton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes:
- Suiton which add or require gallons of water do not do so, however certain jutsu which gain an additional effect from using up water can still be used (if there is enough gallons to do so), if you wish.
- Suiton techniques which normally apply visibility penalties to any area instead apply Immobilization penalties with a severity equal to half (rounded down) that of the normal visibility penalty, and are considered 'Ground' tagged effects (rather than clouds).
- Any applied immobilization penalties that normally fade over time take twice as long to fade.
- All Mokuton techniques can distinguish between allies and enemies and allow you to pick who they will affect. In the case of environmental effects (or those with an upkeep, or which affect an area), you can only distinguish allies and enemies so long as you maintain its Upkeep, and once you stop doing so, it affects everyone equally (including you).
- The Upkeep of Mokuton techniques are reduced by CHA/30, to a minimum of half its original value.
- The Chakra Exhaustion penalties incurred by using Mokuton techniques are reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

Mokuton is weak to Raiton, but strong against Doton and Katon.

#### --( Moku Bunshin no Jutsu - Wood Clone Technique )--
This technique takes advantage of mokuton's ability to accelerate plant growth by converting some of the user's cells into, essentially, plant matter; the wood clone physically buds off the user before taking on their appearance.

- Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C
- Cost: 1 Willpower per clone
- Speed: 10, +3 per clone
- Tags: Clone

Effects: These function like regular bunshin, but have CHA*2 HP, and your attributes. They do not suffer wounds and you may only ever have up to three at once in existence. They may dodge, parry, and perform any other action you normally could, by spending 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action; however, after reaching Fatigue 3 they decay into lifeless wood pulp and fall apart. Wood clones may not take actions with a chakra or stamina cost greater than 18+(RES for Taijutsu, or CHA for Ninjutsu or Genjutsu)/10.

Wood clones have your mind, and can act independently. You are aware of their location, and they yours, though your senses are not linked. You may reabsorb a 'living' wood clone by touching it, in which case you 'download' all its memories.

#### --( Mokuton: Shichuurou no Jutsu - Wood Release: Four Pillars Prison Technique )--
After completing the handseals, you place your hands on the ground and channel your chakra beneath your target, where it bursts from the ground as timbers which grow rapidly and form a wooden, usually cubic, prism. The timbers used in this technique are heavily infused with chakra, making them very resilient.

- Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C
- Chakra: 25
- Range: 30
- Area: Up to 20 yard x 20 yard x 20 yard cube
- Speed: 16
- Seal Speed: 20
- Tags: Area of Effect

Effects: This is the Mokuton 'version' of the Water Prison and/or Water Drowning techniques, which cannot be directly converted into Mokuton themselves.

It creates a wooden cage around anyone who can't escape its area, which has 200+(damage bonus)*15 HP, and reduces all damage it takes by your CHA. People inside cannot attack people outside, and vice versa.

#### --( Mokuton: Jukai Koutan - Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees )--
This technique uses chakra to cause trees and tree roots to grow rapidly, bursting from any surface. It's too unrefined to be used as a direct method of offense, but can be useful for altering the landscape of a battlefield.

- Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank B
- Chakra: 5 + X
- Range: (Damage bonus)*5
- Area: X*2
- Speed: 8
- Seal Speed: 16
- Tags: Area of Effect

Effects: This overwrites any ground effects on the area it's used on. By changing the cost to 5 + X*2, it can be used to create a one-story building. The complexity of this building is determined by your Chakra Control.

At 10 Chakra Control or less, it's more like a crude bundle of tree trunks and branches that will at least keep most of the rain out. From 11 - 20, it's about as well-built as a log cabin, with up to three rooms. At 21 - 30, it could actually pass for a real building, aside from the lack of anything made of metal. At 31+ Chakra Control, you can add a second story to the building.

## Terumi (Autumn, Noble)
One of the original founders of The Temperance. They understood the destructive powers of Heat and Water and when threatened by the Pride, were the driving force that aided in pushing back alongside the Senju. Together, the Senju and the Terumi were powerful allies that used their mastery of Earth, Fire, and Water, to make any terrain favorable and fight favorable. This solidified their claim as a Kyosha going forward and inspired others to join their cause.

**Terumi begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Terumi begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Water, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Futton, which includes Katon and Suiton.

#### -=[ Futton - Boil Release ]=-
Combining Fire and Suiton chakra produces the aptly-named Boil Release, though not all Futton techniques necessarily use boiling water.  Some converted Katon instead manifest as superheated blasts of corrosive mist.

Any Suiton or Katon technique can be converted to Futton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes: 

 - Futton always inflicts Energy wounds
 - Katon techniques add 1/4 of their Chakra cost as gallons of water to the battlefield after resolving
 - Suiton techniques inflict Burns equal to 1/8 of their Chakra cost if their target(s) fail a Status roll
 - Suiton techniques that have a gallons of water requirement can have the water utilized boiled off, increasing their damage by 4% per gallon ‘destroyed’ (this also applies to Suiton which normally remove water from the battlefield)
 - Blocking Futton reduces its damage normally, however for Wounding purposes, Futton is calculated based off of its unreduced damage
 - If partial success applies, Futton deal 50% of their normal damage per point it hits by, rather than 20% (meaning if they hit by more than one, they deal full damage)
 - Futton cannot inflict Ignite; techniques with Ignite deal 5% more damage per point of Ignite they would inflict

Futton is weak to Doton, and strong against Katon and Fuuton.

#### --( Kiri no Ora - Fog Aura )--
While letting superheated fog roll over oneself isn’t ordinarily beneficial, Terumi have developed a use for the Futton variant of Mekkyaku that is more than just a flamboyant effect, holding the veiling mist in place around themselves to create a personal shield of their element which combines perfectly with Kirigakure’s natural climate.

 - Type: Futton Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Chakra: 15
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Speed: 6
 - Seal Speed: 8

Effects: While you maintain this technique’s Upkeep you are veiled in a small cloud of heated mist, applying a -2 Visibility Penalty to anyone trying to target you (though your own vision is not obscured by its presence), which stacks with all other forms of visibility penalties, unlike normal, and anyone who attacks you from melee range is scalded by the fog, taking CHA/2 damage for doing so. If it is dispersed (such as from Cleansing Wind), the Visibility Penalty returns at a rate of 1 per 15 IC. The scalding damage only occurs if the Visibility Penalty is at its full strength (whether or not an attacker is actually penalized by it).

#### --( Sekai ni Tokeru - Dissolving World )--
The Terumi ability to boil water and alter the pH of steam taken to a logical extreme, this boils all water within a broad radius within seconds, flooding the area with a rising high-temperature vapor.

 - Type: Futton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 35 + X/5
 - Damage: (CHA/10 + X)d10
 - Accuracy: +X/15
 - Area: Special
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 22
 - Tags: Point-Blank Area of Effect

Effects: X is how many gallons of water are available to be destroyed from the battlefield, up to a maximum of CHA/2. Its Area is centered on you, and has a minimum of 50, but can go as high as X.

## Touu (Winter)
The Touu actually emerged within The Temperance itself through a sort of Ninshu mutation and discovery with natural chakra. It led to the early breakthroughs of Suiton being able to just conjure water. The Touu go a step further and show an even more advanced control of wind and water. Being able to create and freeze water as they please, and with such control as to freeze the water within the air itself. Eventually the Touu solidified itself as a powerful clan over the next couple decades. Within the war, they sought the Temperance to take them in as refuge and preserve their clan. Without the help of the Temperance, they would have never have reached the level of mastery they have today.

**Touu begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Touu begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water and Wind, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Hyouton, which includes Suiton and Fuuton.

#### -=[ Hyouton - Ice Release ]=-
Touu have the ability to use one of the coveted advanced chakra natures: Ice Release, combining the flexibility of water with the penetrating power of wind.

Any Suiton or Fuuton technique can be converted to Fuuton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes: 

 - Hyouton inflicts Piercing wounds, and Ignores Armor.
 - Blocking reduces the damage of Hyouton techniques by 25% less.
 - Hyouton’s damage for the purpose of wounding is considered 25% higher, which stacks additively with other increases on converted techniques (50% + 25% = 75%)
 - You may forego rolling any or all of the damage dice when using a Hyouton technique, treating the result of those dice as equal to one higher than half the die size (d4’s become 3, d6’s become 4, d8’s become 5, etc).  You must declare how many dice you are applying this to before rolling damage.
 - Fuuton converted to Hyouton may not be used with a fan, and gain a gallons of water requirement equal to 1/5 their Chakra cost.
 - Any technique which would add gallons of water to the battlefield instead leave behind an equivalent amount of ice, as if it had been frozen by Water Sky Convergence (this doesn’t include the gallons needed to perform the technique, but does apply to the water created by a Hyouton Water Creation technique); this works the same with techniques which remove water, removing the same amount of Ice
 - Hyouton techniques inflict Frostbite equal to the rank of the jutsu (E = 1, D = 2, etc)

Hyouton is weak against Katon, and strong against Doton and Suiton

###### --( Frostbite )--
This is a Status Effect, applied on hit. As someone is struck by Hyouton, their core body temperature begins to lower from the extreme cold, slowing their movements and actions.  Frostbite inflicts an Immobilization penalty equal to its severity, and for each point of Frostbite someone has, they take 1% of their current Vitality in damage every 10 IC.  If they have no Vitality remaining, the damage is calculated and done to their HP, instead.

If someone is suffering from Ignite or Frostbite and is then inflicted with the other, they suffer a Burns X from the sudden extreme shift in temperature and immediately lose X% of their Current Vitality, where X is the lower of the two effects.  This also occurrs if Frostbite is removed with Katon such as Ember-Burning Technique, which remove Immobility penalties, treating X as the Frostbite which was removed. (e.g., If you were at Frostbite 5 and were hit with an Ignite 2, your Frostbite would be reduced to 3 and you would receive a Burns 2)

Frostbite from the same source (person) stacks fully with itself; if you suffer Frostbite from different people, only the highest severity applies for both penalties and damage taken. The maximum Frostbite you can afflict someone with is 2 + CHA/30, and fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC (the reduction happens after taking damage from it).

#### -=[ Suitenhoufukyuu - Water Sky Convergence ]=- 
Often considered the mark of the Touu bloodline, even more so than their ability to use Hyouton.  All members of the bloodline, even ones without ninja training, exhibit from a young age the ability to mentally control water. They can lift it off of the ground, cause it to float between their hands, and even freeze it with a thought (or, conversely, liquify ice).

For a child, this is limited to what’s nearby and what they can see; for a skilled ninja, they can actually sense the presence of significant bodies of water (which does not include human beings or large animals).

You can create up to (Chakra Control Ranks)/5 gallons of water or ice when you perform a Suiton or Hyouton technique which requires it, respectively, up to the amount needed for its use, for free.  When Mizu Souzou is required for more gallons of water or ice beyond this amount, its Chakra Cost is reduced by 5, and if you can reduce its Seal Speed to 0, you need not make handseals for it at all.

You may take a Speed X action, with a Chakra cost of 5+2 * X, to freeze or liquify (CHA/30, minimum 1)*X gallons of water on the battlefield. Ice may not be used in Suiton techniques; it can, however, be used to perform Hyouton (including Suiton technique which you have converted to Hyouton).

You can perform Suiton (but not Hyouton) techniques without handseals, by adding (the base Seal Speed - CHA/10)/2, rounded up, to the action’s base Speed.

#### --( Sensatsu Suishou - Thousand Flying Water Needles )--
Water is gathered from the air and then formed into dozens or hundreds (but ‘thousands’ sounds far more impressive) of long, levitating needles. Those needles are then directed at a single target at high speeds; the sheer number of needles sent to a target from all sides at once makes evasion especially difficult.

 - Type: Hyouton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 24
 - Damage: Xd10 + CHA/2
 - Range: 20
 - Speed: 14
 - Seal Speed: 14
 - Requires: X/2 gallons of water and/or ice
 - Tags: Piercing

Effects: X has a maximum of CHA/6. Half the gallons of water and/or ice used with this technique are removed from the battlefield after use.

For the purposes of defending against this technique it is considered a multi-throw, though it is not subject to other multi-throw rules, and it is still considered a Ninjutsu attack. If this attack would Wound an enemy, it also applies a second Wound of one severity lower to the same location (a Minor wound wouldn't get this benefit, but inflicting a Major would also inflict a Minor, etc).

## Yogani (Primal Fire)
A rare recessive trait that seems to come from the affinity of the Temuri and the Hitori. The Temperance has discovered that the nature of Ninshu has learned to evolve within people completely of it’s own will. Meaning that there could, theoretically, be a Chosen One concept to consider if Ninshu decided that there would be some kind of prophecy to fulfill. This mutation was the first of many to prove that Ninshu in human souls had a mind of it’s own and would manifest itself chaotically. Since then, Lava Release had been passed down heretically and is no longer endangered, promised to be preserved by The Temperance.

**Yogani begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Yogani begin with Elemental Aptitude for Doton and Katon ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Yoton, which includes Doton and Katon.

#### -=[ Yoton - Lava Release ]=-
Combining Fire and Doton chakra produces the destructive Lava Release, though not all Yoton are true ‘lava’ and sometimes will manifest as almost acidic, highly corrosive substances, not far removed from mud.

Any Katon or Doton technique can be converted to Yoton as a Chakra +5, Speed +0 link, with the following changes: 

 - Whenever Yoton inflicts a wound, it instead inflicts an Energy Wound, plus a Blunt Wound of one severity lower (to a minimum of Minor).
 - Non-Environmental Yoton inflicts Corrosion equal to its Rank (E = 1, D = 2, C = 3, B = 4, A = 5).
 - Yoton may increase Corrosion to a maximum of CHA/5
 - Yoton's damage is reduced by 50% less from Blocking, normally to 0.
 - Yoton-Converted Katon gain +1 to their Base Speed per Rank, and +1d* to their Damage per Rank (E = 1, D = 2, etc).
 - Yoton-Converted Katon do not inflict Ignite. Non-Environmental Yoton Converted Katon instead inflict Stun equal to the Ignite they would have inflicted.
 - Yoton-Converted Doton that would inflict Immobilize instead inflict Ignite equal to the Immobilize they would have applied. This ignite fades normally, even if the immobilize would have a different duration. For environmental effects that apply an Immobilize Penalty in the area, this ignite is applied again once per consecutive 20 IC they stay within the effected area, after taking damage from ignite that IC (if applicable).

Yoton is weak to Suiton, and strong against Doton and Fuuton.

##### –( Corrosion )–
This is a status effect. As someone is struck by Yoton, they are struck by a combination of kinetic force and heat such that, unlike regular burns or simple kinetic force that one can shrug off in a matter of moments, Yoton has an ability to weaken anything it touches until it breaks, be it through impact or immersion as perhaps one of the most inherently destructive of all advanced elements.

When someone with Corrosion is hit by a damage dealing attack, they roll bonus damage dice. For every damage die showing a 1 or a 2, the attacker adds +1d6 damage. These d6s can trigger additional rolls if they roll a 1 or a 2. No more than (Corrosion)d6 bonus dice may be rolled in this fashion.

When someone with Corrosion is hit by a damage dealing Yoton attack, they instead add a bonus die for every 1, 2 or 3 rolled. If the damage dice are d20s, then it also adds a die for every 4, 5 or 6 rolled. Bonus d6s can cause more bonus d6s to roll on a 1, 2 or 3. No more than (Corrosion)d6 bonus dice may be rolled in this fashion.

Corrosion is very difficult to remove in combat, and requires the aid of a trained Medic-nin in order to do so. For every IC someone has Mystical Palm or Vital Repair used on them (regardless of their Chakra Control), their Corrosion status is reduced by 1.  Out of combat, Corrosion reduces by 1 per 5 minutes of treatment with a first aid kit.

Corrosion stacks partially with itself. If Corrosion would be applied to someone who has Corrosion, then take the higher of the two numbers and add half the lower number (rounded up). So if someone with Corrosion 3 gets Corrosion 5, they would be at Corrosion 5+3/2 = 6.5, rounded up to 7.

#### -–( Yoton: Yokai no Jutsu - Melting Apparition )–-
The user spits out a corrosive mud that erodes anything it touches on contact.  Though strong enough to stagger, what makes it truly deadly is the ability it has to overwhelm other jutsu and turn them into molten debris that flows with it to empower it.

 - Type: Yoton Ninjutsu, Rank C
 - Chakra: 27
 - Damage:  10d20.extra(11)
 - Area: 15
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 11
 - Special: Destroys Armor, Interrupt
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: This jutsu effectively replaces Earth Shore Return and Rising Phoenix Blast for Yogani. Those techniques can not be converted to Yoton.

When not used as an interrupt, this jutsu inflicts Corrosion 3, or increases an existing Corrosion by +3. This jutsu's damage is applied to every location of the target's body for purposes of impacting armor. Its damage is only reduced by armor in the location it actually wounds. Armor which doesn't degrade through being attacked is simply destroyed.

It may also be used as an interrupt against a damaging attack that would affect you, so long as this Jutsu's speed is equal to or less than the incoming attack's Speed (rather than half).

Roll this jutsu's damage, including bonus dice from the attacker's Corrosion. If this jutsu's damage is higher, their attack has no effect within this jutsu's area. The attacker and all other enemies within this jutsu's area increase their existing Corrosion, if any, by +3.

If their damage roll is higher, subtract your damage roll from theirs. That is how much damage their attack deals to you and anyone else it targets within this jutsu's area.

#### -–( Azure Flame Eruption )–-
The Yoton variant of Instant Cremation, the Yogani concentrates their Chakra on a specific point and a few moments later, the ground spontaneously erupts as a miniature volcano.  The more times it is used in an area, the more volcanic and molten the battlefield becomes.

 - Type: Yoton Ninjutsu, Rank B
 - Chakra: 24
 - Damage: (20 + X * 2)d20
 - Upkeep: X
 - Range: 30
 - Area: 2 * (X + 1)
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 20
 - Tags: Energy, Ground

Effects: This Jutsu replaces Instant Cremation for Yoton, which can not itself be converted to Yoton.

After using Azure Flame Eruption, you can choose to gain a special Upkeep X, which increases by 1 each time you use Azure Flame Eruption.

So long as X is one or greater, Azure Flame Eruption does not require handseals. Azure Flame Eruption’s special Upkeep is unaffected by Uniques or Wounds which would affect normal Upkeeps.

Azure Flame Eruption inflicts 4+X Corrosion, rather than 4.

Within its Area, all other environmental effects are removed and replaced by sulfurous fumes. Every 10 IC that someone spends within the fumes adds a Suffocation 1 status to them.

## Yotsuki (Balance)
The Raikoga believe that the uniting of paths and clans will lead to the degradation of their legacy and watered down traditions. Though there are some who believe that the Tribunal is a good cause for the threats that the shinobi world face. Though some of them are outcasts, they climbed the mountains and sought shelter with the Temperance Monastery. It was there they were given a warm welcome and received additional training and perspective. Although this is a sect of the Yotsuki that is no longer with the precursor lightning country, their growth through coexistence has cause them to flourish.

#### -–( Kiryu - Energy Flow )–-
The cornerstone of the Yotsuki Clan's power, this cloak absorbs elemental energy from attacks or the environment, granting resilience and adapting its properties to reflect the absorbed element. The user glows faintly with the hue of the absorbed chakra, striking an imposing figure in combat. This technique is the foundation for all subsequent Elemental Cloak abilities.

 - Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D
 - Speed: 10
 - Chakra: 15
 - Upkeep: 5
 - Special: If you have Affinity with all active Elements, -3 Upkeep
 - Tags: Preparation, Nintaijutsu

Effects:  Select one element you have Aptitude for when you activate this technique. Your body becomes attuned to that element while you maintain it, causing an aura of that element to wreathe their body, protecting and empowering them.  You become immune to all non-environmental Status Effects from that element, reduce damage taken from that element by 25%, and cause your unarmed attacks to be considered the element chosen for the purposes of elemental interactions, as well as a bonus based on your chosen element:  

 - **Doton**:   You gain (8 + NDB) * (1 + X) Damage Reduction, and all of your damage-dealing, non-grapple unarmed attacks that are unaffected by partial success cause the target to be knocked prone (if the attack has no partial success, it does not gain this effect). If you attack someone who is prone, those same attacks also gain the Damage Reduction from this feature as added damage to your attack.
 - **Fuuton**:  Whenever you succeed on an unarmed parry, you deal your NDB * (Parry’s final Speed + X) damage back to the attacker automatically, and can elect to knock them away from, or pull them toward, you (NDB + X)/2 yards.
 - **Katon**:   unarmed attacks apply Burns 3, while all Combo Counter and Combo Bonus lines gain “+0.2 * (1 + X) PDB”, with a maximums bonus of your PDB.
 - **Raiton**:  Unarmed Taijutsu reduce their speeds by (1 + X), which does not reduce their damage, and bypass half of an opponent’s DR.
 - **Suiton**:  After successfully defending against an attack, you may perform a Basic Unarmed Attack as a Speed 0 interrupt at its normal cost; it is defended against at its normal speed, but does not advance your IC, though it may only be performed once every (14 - X * 2) IC. Every 10 gallons of Water on the battlefield causes you to be able to make this Interrupt attack at +1 Range, to a maximum of (NDB + X) yards, though they are still considered melee attacks, not ranged.

X begins at 0 for this technique.

#### -=[ Elemental Ascendance ]=-
With sufficient training, a Yotsuki can further concentrate their element, and even combine elements as they please.  While some choose to fully commit themselves to a singular element, others utilize the full abundance of nature in order to create multi-colored auras that allow for truly impossible types of taijutsu.

 - Base Cose: 5
 - Scale: 5
 - Limit: CHA/25, Max 4

Effects: For every Rank in this Ability, you can choose when you activate Kiryu, or as a separate Speed 6, CE 12 action, to do one of the following: Increase X by 1, or activate another Element.  In the latter case of adding additional elements, you do not gain additional status effect immunities (which are based solely on your ‘main’ element), however you do take less damage from all elements chosen, and your attacks are considered to be simultaneously all elements utilized for the purposes of defending against them.  You can utilize the separate action to likewise change which element is considered your main element for status effect immunities.

You must meet all of Kiryu’s normal rules for which elements you take (meaning you must have that element’s Aptitude), and activating more than one element causes Kiryu’s Upkeep to increase by 1 per additional element beyond the first, alongside potentially increasing it further if you do not have Affinity for all elements activated to qualify for its Special feature (meaning normally two elements active would be Upkeep 5 + 1 = 6, even if one of them is your affinity, as you are utilizing one which is not).
